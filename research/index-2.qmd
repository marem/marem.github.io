![A phase-based behavioural design framework was successfully designed, implemented and assessed to effectively explore and modify cookstove-related behaviours.](../images/Fig_BCD.jpg){#fig-bcd}

![Investigated customer preferences for improved flame-based cookstove features in South Africa.](../images/Fig_Mamelodi.jpg){#fig-mamelodi}
:::

Marcel's scholarly work centres on advancing sustainable energy solutions in sub-Saharan Africa, with a specific focus on the strategic design and widespread dissemination of improved cookstoves. His interdisciplinary research approach integrates design thinking with social marketing principles [@Mare2010-hs].

#### Social Marketing and Consumer Preferences

His work has contributed to understanding the role of social marketing in the adoption of improved bio-energy technologies [@Mare2010-hs]. He has further investigated consumer preferences for cookstove features in South African regions, employing willingness-to-pay surveys to refine marketing strategies for stove dissemination [@Mare2013-dz; @Mare2014-hd], as illustrated in @fig-mamelodi.

#### Service Design and Behavioural Goals

He has explored the application of service design principles to identify and implement behavioural goals that could boost the uptake of improved cookstoves [@Mare2016-fu; @Mare2017-tt]. This approach signifies a shift from product-focused strategies to comprehensive service design strategies, emphasising human-centred design and observational field research.

#### Behavioural Change through Design Approaches

Since 2021 his research delves into the influence of Behaviour Centred Design (BCD) on the health and wellbeing of indigent households in South Africa [@Mare2018-uq; @Mare2021-kp; @Mare2023-uu]. As illustrated in @fig-bcd, he examined how BCD approaches can modify cookstove-related behaviours and address broader social, economic, and environmental challenges.
