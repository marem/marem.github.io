I think it is an elegant solution to visualize statistical mix effects and address Simpson’s paradox, and particularly useful when working with longitudinal data involving different sub-populations. Recently I found a good excuse to spend some time to actually use it as part of a exploratory data analysis on a project.\n\nSince I mostly work in Python and have recently fallen in love with [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html) — for the same reasons as [Fernando explains here](http://fernandoi.cl/blog/posts/altair/) — I wondered how the comet chart could be implemented using the [grammar of interactive graphics](https://idl.cs.washington.edu/papers/vega-lite/). It took me a while to figure out how to actually plot the comets. In a previous version, I had [drawn glyphs using Bokeh](https://github.com/dkapitan/comet-chart/blob/master/comet-chart.ipynb). While Altair allows you to plot any SVG path in a graph, this felt a bit hacky and not quite in line with the philosophy of using a grammar of graphics.\n\nThankfully [Mattijn was quick to suggest using trail-marks](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair/issues/2395#issuecomment-766454328), after which it was almost as easy as pie. So here’s an example using a dataset of 20,000 flights for 59 destination airports.\n\n```{python}\nimport altair as alt\nimport pandas as pd\nimport vega_datasets\n\n\nflights = vega_datasets.data.flights_20k()\naggregation = dict(\n    number_of_flights=(\"destination\", \"count\"),\n    mean_delay=(\"delay\", \"mean\"),\n    mean_distance=(\"distance\", \"mean\"),\n)\n\n# Compare delays by destination between month 1 and 3\ngrouped = flights.groupby(by=[flights.destination, flights.date.dt.month])\ndf = (\n    grouped.agg(**aggregation)\n    .loc[(slice(None), [1, 3]), :]\n    .assign(\n        change_mean_delay=lambda df:\n            df.groupby(\"destination\")[\"mean_delay\"].diff(),\n    )\n    .bfill()  # <--- Changed from .fillna(method=\"bfill\")\n    .reset_index()\n    .round(2)\n)\n\n# Calculate weigthed average of delays for month 1 and 3\ntotal = (\n    flights.groupby(flights.date.dt.month)\n    .agg(**aggregation)\n    .loc[[1, 3], :]\n    .assign(\n        change_mean_delay=lambda df: df.mean_delay.diff(),\n        destination='TOTAL'\n    )\n    .bfill()  # <--- Changed from .fillna(method=\"bfill\")\n    .round(2)\n    .reset_index()\n    .loc[:, df.columns]\n)\n\n\ndef comet_chart(df, stroke=\"white\"):\n    return (\n    alt.Chart(df, width=600, height=450)\n    .mark_trail(stroke=stroke)\n    .encode(\n        x=alt.X(\"number_of_flights\", scale=alt.Scale(type=\"log\")),\n        y=alt.Y(\"mean_delay\"),\n        detail=\"destination\",\n        size=alt.Size(\"date\", scale=alt.Scale(range=[0, 10]), legend=None),\n        tooltip=[\n            \"destination\",\n            \"number_of_flights\",\n            \"mean_delay\",\n            \"change_mean_delay\",\n            \"mean_distance\",\n        ],\n        # trails don't support continuous color\n        # see https://github.com/vega/vega/issues/1187\n        # hence use bins\n        color=alt.Color(\n            \"change_mean_delay:Q\",\n            bin=alt.Bin(step=2),\n            scale=alt.Scale(scheme=\"blueorange\"),\n            legend=alt.Legend(orient=\"top\"),\n        ),\n    )\n)\n\n\ncomet_chart(df) + comet_chart(total, stroke=\"black\")\n```\n\nIn the example shown here, each comet represents one destination airport. The head of the comet corresponds to the most recent observation of the number of flight arrivals (x-axis, shown as logarithmic scale to accommodate the wide range of observations) against the mean delay of those flights (y-axis). The tail of the comet represents a similar (x,y) datum, but from an earlier point in time. Finally, the colour of the comet is encoded to show the change in the mean delay for each airport. A tooltip with a summary of the data is shown when hovering over the head of the comet.\n\nSo-called mix effects can often lead to misinterpretation of aggregate numbers. In the example of flight delays, the fact that only a small change is observed in the mean delay across all airports — visualized with the right-most comet outlined in black — hides the underlying variance between airports. Note that in this example the size of each sub-population (number of flights per airport) remains relatively constant, hence the comets here only go up and down. As explained in [the original article](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/42901.pdf), mix effects become harder to interpret when the relative size of the sub-populations change as well as their relative values. In the most extreme case this may lead to [Simpson’s paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox).\n\nWith this base implementation of comet charts in Altair, you can really go to town and combine it with other interactive graphs. Using the [overview-detail](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/scatter_with_layered_histogram.html) pattern, you could plot an accompanying density plot of all the flights for a given airport. That way you can quickly zoom in to the lowest level of detail and get a better understanding of the underlying mix effects.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n[Zan Armstrong’s comet chart](https://www.zanarmstrong.com/#/infovisresearch/) has been on my list of hobby projects for a while now.
