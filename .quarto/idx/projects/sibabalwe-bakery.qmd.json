Executive Snapshot","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\n\n- **Role:** Behavioural Researcher & Strategic Design Lead\n- **Duration:** Multi-phase community intervention\n- **Context:** Informal settlement households using unsafe flame-based cooking systems\n\n**Core Problem:** Low adoption of safer cookstove technologies despite significant health and safety risks.\n\n**Outcome:** Designed and implemented a community-based behavioural intervention using bread-baking as a participatory catalyst, contributing to measurable shifts in cookstove ownership patterns and safety perceptions.\n\n## 2. Strategic Context\n\nIn many low-resource South African communities, households rely on open-flame cooking systems, paraffin, and biomass fuels, often within structurally unsafe stoves.\n\n**Consequences include:**\n- Respiratory illness and indoor air pollution\n- Burn injuries\n- Fuel inefficiency and financial strain\n\nDespite the availability of safer alternatives, adoption rates remained low because barriers were not purely economic—they were behavioural, cultural, and identity-linked. The challenge was shifted from a product distribution problem to a **behavioural systems challenge**: shifting motivations and norms without imposing external solutions.\n\n## 3. Research & Diagnostic Phase\n\n### Research Questions\n- What symbolic and cultural meanings are attached to cooking with fire?\n- What prevents households from transitioning to safer cookstoves?\n- Which social influences shape ownership decisions?\n- How do risk perceptions align with daily lived realities?\n\n### Methods\n- Ethnographic fieldwork and in-home observations\n- Semi-structured interviews and behavioural mapping\n- Co-creation workshops and informal community discussions\n- Artefact analysis of existing stove types and usage patterns\n\n### Constraints\n- Financial vulnerability and infrastructure instability\n- Deep-rooted cooking traditions\n- Trust barriers toward external interventions\n\n> **Key Diagnostic Insight:** The cookstove was not merely a utility device; it represented identity, competence, and family provision. Therefore, messaging focused solely on \"health risks\" failed to motivate change.\n\n## 4. Key Behavioural Insights\n\n1.  **Normalisation of Risk:** Health dangers were acknowledged but behaviourally discounted.\n2.  **Social Proof Dominance:** Adoption decisions were strongly influenced by visible community norms.\n3.  **Aspirational Identity Leverage:** Participants responded better to narratives of capability and pride than to fear.\n4.  **Demonstration Over Instruction:** Hands-on experience produced stronger engagement than informational campaigns.\n\n## 5. Intervention Design\n\nThe curriculum was structured around three behavioural pillars:\n\n1.  **Reframe Cooking with Improved Cookstoves** Rather than attacking the use of \"inefficient\" cooking methods, the intervention elevated controlled, skilled routines with improved cooking technologies through baking bread.\n2.  **Social Visibility:** Creating shared baking events to establish new behavioural routines and norms.\n3.  **Emotional Demonstration (Emo-Demo):** Using experiential sessions to embed safety practices through participation.\n\n### The Sibabalwe Bakery Model\nThe bakery acted as a stage for collective preparation, sharing, and open discussion of safe, clean and economically viable cooking practices.\n\n## 6. Implementation\n\n- Facilitated co-creative workshops with community ambassadors.\n- Iterative refinement of demonstration formats based on cohort feedback.\n- Embedded reflective discussions and monitoring of post-intervention choices.\n- Adaptive pacing to manage resource constraints and infrastructure disruptions.\n\n## 7. Impact & Evidence\n\n**Qualitative outcomes included:**\n- Increased discussion and visibility of stove safety within households.\n- Shift in expressed motivations for stove choice.\n- Positive changes in ownership patterns following intervention cycles.\n\n**Behavioural indicators observed:**\n- Participants voluntarily demonstrating safer cooking techniques to peers.\n- Organic emergence of peer-to-peer advocacy.\n- Increased inquiry into alternative, safer stove options.\n\n## 8. Strategic Value & Transferability\n\nThis intervention demonstrates the application of behavioural design to digital and physical transformation. It provides a scalable model for:\n\n- **Public Health & Sustainability:** Energy transition through social leverage.\n- **Corporate ESG:** Community-driven norm transformation for product adoption.\n- **Policy Design:** Workforce and community development through participatory interventions.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## 1.
