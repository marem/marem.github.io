Strategic Context\n\nThe acceleration of generative AI tools has disrupted entry pathways into the creative industries. For historically marginalised creatives, this presented both:\n\n- Opportunity (expanded tool access)\n- Risk (skill displacement and identity erosion)\n\nThere was limited structured education focused on:\n\n- Ethical AI integration\n- Identity formation\n- Translating AI fluency into employability\n\nThe intervention aimed to close this capability gap.\n\n## 3. Research & Diagnostic Phase\n\n### Research Questions\n\n- How do emerging creatives perceive AI in relation to authorship and identity?\n- What capability gaps limit effective AI adoption?\n- What behavioural barriers affect experimentation and confidence?\n\n### Methods\n\n- Pre-workshop reflective surveys\n- Facilitated group discussions\n- In-session observation\n- Iterative feedback loops\n- Artefact analysis (outputs created using AI tools)\n\n### Tools Explored\n\n- Figma (design workflows)\n- Midjourney (visual generation)\n- ChatGPT (ideation & structuring)\n- RunwayML (video augmentation)\n- Jitter (motion design)\n\n### Constraints\n\n- Uneven digital literacy\n- Variable access to hardware\n- Psychological resistance to AI\n\n## 4. Key Insights\n\n1.  **Identity Anxiety:** Participants feared AI would replace their originality.\n2.  **Tool Overwhelm:** Exposure without structure led to shallow experimentation.\n3.  **Confidence Deficit:** Low belief in professional competitiveness limited ambition.\n4.  **Opportunity Gap:** Few participants knew how to translate AI use into employability language.\n\n## 5. Intervention Design\n\nBased on findings, the curriculum was structured around three behavioural pillars:\n\n1.  **Identity Before Tools:** Reflection-first exercises anchored AI use in personal narrative.\n2.  **Structured Experimentation:** Tool use embedded within defined creative challenges.\n3.  **Translation to Employability:** Outputs reframed as portfolio artefacts with articulated design rationale.\n\nThe workshops combined:\n\n- Guided prompts\n- Co-creation exercises\n- Live tool demonstration\n- Structured critique cycles\n- Meta-reflection\n\n## 6. Implementation\n\n- Multi-session modular format\n- Progressive tool complexity\n- Peer collaboration\n- Iterative content refinement\n- Adaptive pacing based on cohort feedback\n\n## 7. Impact & Evidence\n\nQualitative outcomes included:\n\n- Increased reported confidence in AI tool usage\n- Stronger articulation of creative identity\n- Production of portfolio-ready artefacts\n- Greater clarity on positioning within creative industry roles\n\nBehavioural indicators observed:\n\n- Reduced hesitation in tool experimentation\n- Increased peer feedback engagement\n- Clearer self-descriptions of creative value proposition\n\n## 8.
