Strategic Context\n\nDuring major sporting events like the Commonwealth Games, the margin between winning and losing is often found in immediate technical adjustments.

Research & Interaction Design\n\nThe system was built with a focus on **Interaction Design**, ensuring that the technical complexity of remote production did not hinder the speed of coaching decisions.\n\n### Key Focus Areas:\n- **Real-Time Latency:** Reducing the delay between the athletic action and the video relay.\n- **Remote Access:** Ensuring coaching staff could access high-quality feeds from various vantage points.\n- **User Interface:** Streamlining the capture process to be intuitive for production teams.\n\n## 4. Implementation & Mentoring\n\nBeyond the technical architecture, a significant portion of the project focused on capability building:\n\n- **System Deployment:** Executed the seamless capture and relay of athletic performance across multiple event sites.\n- **Mentoring:** Provided hands-on training for the team in non-linear video editing techniques.\n- **Tool Creation:** Developed custom digital coaching tools to facilitate on-the-fly performance analysis.\n\n## 5.
