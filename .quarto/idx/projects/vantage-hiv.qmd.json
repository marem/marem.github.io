Executive Snapshot","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\n\n- **Role:** Behavioural Strategist (Collaborator with BCA Team)\n- **Target Group:** Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) at risk of HIV\n- **Context:** Public health crisis involving low medication adherence\n\n**Core Problem:** High rates of HIV risk paired with low adherence to life-saving antiretroviral (ARV) medication and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among vulnerable youth populations.\n\n**Outcome:** Developed a multi-channel behavioural journey that successfully improved adherence rates by aligning communication \"nudges\" with the core motivations of the target demographic.\n\n## 2. Strategic Context\n\nIn the fight against HIV, the availability of medication (ARVs and PrEP) is only half the battle. For adolescent girls and young women, the barriers to consistent usage are often non-clinical, including:\n\n- **Social Stigma:** Fear of being seen with medication.\n- **Routine Disruption:** Difficulty integrating daily pills into fluid lifestyles.\n- **Motivation Gaps:** A lack of immediate perceived benefit vs. long-term risk.\n\nThe project aimed to transform medical compliance into a relatable, motivated daily habit.\n\n\n\n## 3. Intervention Design: The Behavioural Journey\n\nThe intervention was built on a comprehensive **behavioural journey map** that identified every friction point from initial awareness to daily pill-taking.\n\n### Key Design Pillars\n- **Motivation-Linked Touchpoints:** Every interaction was designed to trigger a specific internal motivator (e.g., autonomy, safety, or future-self aspirations).\n- **The \"Nudge\" Ecosystem:** Rather than a single message, we created a surrounding environment of reminders.\n\n## 4. Implementation & Touchpoints\n\nThe strategy was deployed across multiple channels to meet users where they already exist:\n\n- **Community Radio Spots:** Used for broad social proof and to normalise the conversation around PrEP/ARVs.\n- **Social Media Messaging:** Targeted content designed to build a supportive digital community and reduce stigma.\n- **Personalised Reminders:** Direct-to-user nudges that felt supportive rather than clinical, helping to overcome the \"forgetting\" barrier.\n\n## 5. Impact & Evidence\n\nThe project successfully shifted the needle on adherence through:\n\n- **Improved Adherence Rates:** Measurable increase in consistent ARV and PrEP usage among the target cohort.\n- **Enhanced Motivation:** Qualitative feedback indicated that users felt more empowered and less \"policed\" regarding their health choices.\n- **Optimised Communication:** Evidence-based refinement of which messages resonated most with AGYW.\n\n## 6. Strategic Value & Transferability\n\nThis project illustrates the power of **Behavioural Design** in a public health context. The framework of mapping \"touchpoints to motivations\" is highly transferable to:\n\n- **Chronic Disease Management:** Improving long-term adherence for diabetes or hypertension.\n- **Preventative Health:** Encouraging vaccination uptake or regular screenings.\n- **Youth Engagement:** Designing social services that resonate with hard-to-reach younger demographics.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to expand the **Implementation** section with specific examples of the social media messaging used to reduce stigma?```","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## 1.
