Organisations are not machines; they are social, political, and behavioural systems. Navigating them takes more than expertise.

I currently lead **Moruti Consulting**, where I focus on designing solutions that support sustainable, systemic change in energy, urban development, and public services.\n\nMy work sits at the intersection of policy, technology, and human behaviour. I work with teams who are grappling with the reality of complexity and the weight of organisational inertia. I view my role as part editor, part interpreter, and part early warning system—spotting fault lines early and keeping strategy grounded in the conditions that matter most.\n\n### The Moruti Approach\n\nStrategy often fails because it is treated as a plan for a machine. I treat organisations as social and political systems. My goal is to bring clarity to problems before they become expensive distractions and to ensure that ambition is met with an equal measure of operational reality.\n\n### Areas of Expertise\n\nStrategic Design, Problem Reframing, Systemic Change, Behavioural Science, Digital Innovation, Public Service Design, Energy Transition, and Urban Development.\n\n### Locations\n\nBased in **Cape Town, South Africa**, working globally to help organisations navigate ambiguity and deliver meaningful impact.\n\n### Contact details\n\n**email:** [contact@marcelmare.com](mailto:contact@marcelmare.com)\n\n\n**Socials:** [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marem1969) | [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/marem1969) | [X](https://x.com/marem1969)\n\n```{=html}\n<a href=\"mailto:contact@marcelmare.com\" class=\"btn btn-primary btn-lg\" type=\"button\">Get in touch</a>\n```","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n```{=html}\n<!-- Bug in hero - only displays properly with empty div at the top -->\n<div class=\"jumbotron bgimg\">\n  <div class=\"container\">\n    <h1 class=\"display-4\"></h1>\n    <p class=\"lead\"></p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n.bgimg {\n  background-image: url('images/home-hero.jpg');\n  Background-size: cover;\n}\n.lead {\n    font-family: \"Zilla Slab\";\n    text-align: center;\n}\n.hero-quote {\n  font-family: \"Zilla Slab\";\n  font-color: white;\n  color: white;\n}\n\n.fw-bold {\n  /* font-family: \"Zilla Slab Highlight\"; */\n  font-style: bold !important;\n  color: white !important;\n}\n</style>\n<div class=\"p-5 mb-4 bg-light rounded-3 bgimg\">\n  <br><br><br><br>\n  <div class=\"hero-quote\">\n    <h1 class=\"display-5 fw-bold\">I Help<br>People<br>Think Clearly</h1>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"lead\">\n   <small class=\"text-hero\">STRATEGIC DESIGN &emsp; | &emsp; BEHAVIOURAL SCIENCE &emsp; | &emsp; DESIGN WITH AI</small>\n   <br>\n   <small class=\"text-hero\">COACHING & MENTORING &emsp; | &emsp; WORKSHOPS & PUBLIC SPEAKING</small>\n</p>\n```\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n::: {.grid}\n::: {.g-col-1}\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-10}\n#### Strategy is not a PowerPoint deck.\n\nMost strategic failures begin before delivery.
