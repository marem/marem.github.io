Put them in the beans with the salt and gula jawa, and add 100 ml of water. I bring the beans to the boil and then turn the gas down so that it can simmer very quietly with the lid on the pan. Occasionally (once every 10 minutes) I stir everything so it can not stick to the bottom. Let simmer for 50 minutes.\n- In the meantime, I warm up the coconut milk with half a cup of water (my coconut milk is quite thick).\n- I add two pandan leaves and a pinch of salt into the coconut milk and warm it up. When I see a few bubbles (it boils), I stir everything and turn the gas off. I let my coconut milk sit with the lid on. The pandan leaves had the time to give off their amazing flavor.\n- Back to the beans. After 50 minutes I see during a stirring session that some beans start to lose their skins.\n- I turn off the gas and let the porridge rest for a while, **about 20 minutes**. It is still too hot to eat and that makes the porridge even more porridge.\n- I scoop the beans into a large dish and pour over the re-heated coconut milk. Most beans have still retained their shape, but are buttery tender. I love that I still see what I eat. Do you want them even mushier, then just boil a little longer.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n:::{.grid}\n:::{.g-col-8}\nTaken from [PisangSusu.com](https://pisangsusu.com/bubur-kacang-hijau-mung-bean-porridge/).
