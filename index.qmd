#### Strategy is not a PowerPoint deck.

Most strategic failures are born before delivery. Execution is rarely the problem. The flaw lies in how we frame the challenge from the start. Painpoints and problems are frequently misnamed, oversimplified, already compromised by the quiet drag of organisational inertia.

#### Designing for Reality

I partner with teams facing complexity and ambiguity to turn abstract ambition into outcomes that survive the "push back" of reality. Organisations are not machines; they are complex material, social, and mental ecosystems. Navigating them requires pattern recognition, timing, and a deep sensitivity to context.

I help you bridge the gap between where you are and where the strategy says you should be.

### Strategic Design Consulting

My job is to interrogate underlying logic and stress-test the story. I bring strategy into alignment with the constraints and conditions that will shape its success. By identifying operational tensions early, I help teams prioritise based on what can actually move, not just what looks impressive.

### Systems Change & Designing for Emergence

Leading solutions in energy, development, and public services requires a systemic lens that views organisations as living ecosystems. I work across silos to translate ideas into decisions, and decisions into action. I cultivate the conditions where collective intelligence can surface. I help teams navigate the space between policy and practice to ensure strategy remains grounded in reality.

### Behavioural Science & Design

Designing for humans requires understanding the intersection of policy, technology, and human behaviour. I help organisations navigate the complex fault lines where strategy meets culture. This is the "invisible function" of a strategist: making sense of ambiguity to keep strategy grounded in human conditions.

### Masterclasses & Speaking

I provide sessions designed to help leadership teams think clearly under pressure. These are not standard lectures, but provocations meant to demystify complexity and help professionals obtain the strategic autonomy needed to imagine and create in high-stakes environments.
