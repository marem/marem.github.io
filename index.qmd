#### Strategy is not a PowerPoint deck.

Most strategic failures begin before delivery. They are not execution problems, but framing problems—flawed from the moment the challenge is misnamed or oversimplified. Ambition often succumbs to the quiet drag of organisational inertia.

#### Designing for Reality

I partner with teams facing complexity and ambiguity to turn abstract ambition into outcomes that survive the "push back" of reality. Organisations are not machines; they are social, political, and behavioural systems. Navigating them takes more than expertise. It takes pattern recognition, timing, and a deep sensitivity to context.

I help you bridge the gap between where you are and where the strategy says you should be.

### Strategic Design Consulting

My job is to interrogate underlying logic and stress-test the story. I bring strategy into alignment with the constraints and conditions that will shape its success. By identifying operational tensions early, I help teams prioritise based on what can actually move, not just what looks impressive.

### Systemic Change

Leading solutions in energy, urban development, and public services requires a systemic lens. I work across silos to translate ideas into decisions, and decisions into action. I act as an "early warning system," sensing misalignment before it hardens into conflict or inertia.

### Behavioural Science & Design

Designing for humans requires understanding the intersection of policy, technology, and human behaviour. I help organisations navigate the complex fault lines where strategy meets culture. This is the "invisible function" of a strategist: making sense of ambiguity to keep strategy grounded in human conditions.

### Masterclasses & Speaking

I provide sessions designed to help leadership teams think clearly under pressure. These are not standard lectures, but provocations meant to demystify complexity and help professionals obtain the strategic autonomy needed to imagine and create in high-stakes environments.

# About me {#about-me}

I’m a strategic design consultant with over twenty years of experience working across academia, behavioural science, and digital innovation. I currently lead **Moruti Consulting**, where I focus on designing solutions that support sustainable, systemic change in energy, urban development, and public services.

My work sits at the intersection of policy, technology, and human behaviour. I work with teams who are grappling with the reality of complexity and the weight of organisational inertia. I view my role as part editor, part interpreter, and part early warning system—spotting fault lines early and keeping strategy grounded in the conditions that matter most.

Strategy often fails because it is treated as a plan for a machine. I treat organisations as social ecosystems. My goal is to bring clarity to problems before they become expensive distractions and to ensure that ambition is met with an equal measure of operational reality.

### Areas of Expertise

Strategic Design, Problem Reframing, Systemic Change, Behavioural Science, Digital Innovation, Public Service Design, Energy Transition, and Urban Development.

### Locations

Based in **Cape Town, South Africa**, working globally to help organisations navigate ambiguity and deliver meaningful impact.
