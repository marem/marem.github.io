Seemingly inspired by the enigmatic frog deity <strong>Kek</strong>&#8212;an ancient Egyptian symbol of darkness, chaos, and the unseen forces that bring light&#8212;Szauder&#8217;s work feels like a poetic response to the seismic shifts rippling through the creative industries today.</p><blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DExUWbaIzM4/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading">View this post on Instagram</a></strong></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DExUWbaIzM4/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading">A post shared by David Szauder (@davidszauder)</a></p></blockquote><p>The video unfolds like a fever dream&#8212;or perhaps a digital-age myth&#8212;as amorphous, chaotic forms dissolve, shift, and reassemble into fleeting moments of clarity, all set to the iconic hip-hop anthem <em>Jump</em> by House of Pain. Ancient symbolism collides with 21st-century disarray, crafting what feels like a mesmerising digital afterlife for the world of myth.</p><p>In ancient Egypt, frogs were more than nocturnal creatures&#8212;they symbolised transformation, heralding light from the depths of darkness. In Szauder&#8217;s animation, the frog is reimagined as a stand-in for the disruptive force of AI: unsettling, unpredictable, and, as the playful title <strong>HTYGF (How to Train Your Giant Frog)</strong> suggests, impossibly transformative.</p><p>What lingers, however, is not just the dazzling spectacle but the pressing questions it raises for the year ahead. Generative AI tools are rapidly challenging long-held workflows in 3D modelling and texturing. Where does this leave the artists and designers whose craft was built on manual precision and expertise? Are we witnessing the beginning of an unraveling&#8212;or the chaotic spark of an extraordinary creative renaissance?</p><p>Szauder doesn&#8217;t attempt to answer these questions outright. Like <strong>Kek</strong>, who straddled the line between light and shadow, destruction and creation, his work suggests that progress often emerges from disruption. The animation asks us to confront the generative potential of chaos and to reimagine a creative industry suspended between anxiety and possibility.</p><p>Watching his piece, I felt both excitement and unease. The frog myth has indeed leapt into the digital age, reminding us that, even in an AI-dominated landscape, the essence of creation still begins in the unknown.</p><p>As the lyrics echo in my mind:</p><p><em>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to get out your seat and jump around, Disruption&#8217;s the beat, so don&#8217;t stand your ground.</em>&#8220;</p><p>What&#8217;s your take? Is this a leap toward a brighter creative future&#8212;or a harbinger of chaos that challenges the very foundations of artistry?</p>
