    "text": "TL;DR\n\n\n\nHow to integrate Calibre, Quarto, Obsidian, Syncthing, reMarkable to make the most of a fully integrated markdown-based workflow for reading, thinking and writing.\nKeeping things organised and efficient is one of my basic needs. It helps me keep a clear mind and be productive. I have been using the getting things done method for over a decade now, and was one of the early adopters of Todoist. In fact, at my current rate of 80 points per week, I expect to become Enlightened somewhere at the beginning of the upcoming Year of the Dragon.\nBeyond organising the things I need to do, I have been looking to sharpen my saw for reading and writing, both of which I do a lot. Also here, I switched to a fully digital workflow some years ago: my books now all live in calibre, I take notes on the reMarkable 2 and do all of my writing in markdown. Over the years, I have tried many different apps: Day One, iA Writer and even a bare-bones code editor with a GitHub repository hosting a MkDocs site.\nBut I was never quite satisfied with any of these setups. To address my note-taking needs whilst reading, I tried different tablets with digital pens, but found none of these worked for me because I could not easily get my highlights and notes into my workflow. I also prefer to read on a passive, e-ink screen which is why I tried the reMarkable mark I when it first came out. Alas, I quickly returned that one because it lacked the integrations I needed, too. So here I am, still spending lots of time looking up quotes and references that I had read somewhere when writing content for my lectures. And on top of that there is the additional friction of getting my markdown notes into my publishing workflow.\nIn this day and age, surely there must be a better way in which we can use digital tools to support our reading, thinking and writing? Surely I should be able to render a website, a pdf - even a Word document if a clients asks for it - using the same markdown content? And indeed, it seems that as of 2022 a number of tools have delivered on the promise of supporting a smooth, fully digital workflow for reading, thinking and writing. In my case, I chose Obsidian and Quarto as the core components.1"

    "text": "Obsidian, arguably the most flexible note-taking app\nObsidian arguably is the most flexible note-taking app out there. The key differentiating feature for me is its ability to create graphs of interlinked notes, thereby natively supporting Andy Matuschak’s Evergreen note-taking concept. Its vibrant community is also a boon: with over 1,370 contributed plugins at the time of writing , I could find everything I need to integrate it with the other tools in my workflow.\nThe diagram below shows how I have integrated calibre and Obsidian for use on my MacBook, Pixel 5 Android phone and reMarkable 2. Syncthing does the heavy lifting of keeping my markdown notes and ebooks in sync across multiple devices. That way, I have maximal control with the least amount of lock-in. Incidentally, my calibre library is also synced to my NAS, with an additional backup to Google Drive which serves as my primary storage platform. Note that this setup work for any combination of {Linux | OSX | Windows} desktops and {iOS | Android} smartphones, as all the apps are cross-platform.2\n\n\nEasier to read, think and take notes\nWith this setup, taking notes while reading books on my smartphone already is a lot easier. Using Moon+ Reader, I can just highlight texts, copy and paste it directly into Obsidian. For longer reads on my reMarkable, I have setup scrybble to sync notes to Obsidian. This Amsterdam-based startup (yay!) is quite young, and the functionality is still basic so am eagerly awaiting future releases.\nWhen I am at the desk, I can now do all of my reading and note-taking in Obsidian thanks to the calibre plugin. After tinkering with the configuration, I found it so blissful being able to read, think and write from a single application. No distractions! Also, now I can gradually ease into the Evergreen way of note-taking to structure my thinking. Opening a linked note using Cmd+T, with the stack notes option turned on, just adds to the joy of working like this:\n\n\n\nEasier to write and publish\nFurther down into the workflow, I can now write and publish from Obsidian, too. This paper in fact served as a challenge-based learning project of sorts to do exactly that. Drawing diagrams with d2 is supported thanks to the official plugin. I could also publish a static site directly on, say, GitHub pages from Obsidian as well using the Obsidian Git plugin. I find, however, that the Quarto engine is the better tool for my publishing needs."

    "text": "Quarto for a streamlined publication workflow\nMy work as a data scientist and architect relies extensively on code and data analysis. Python-based notebooks have long provided the capability of merging the paper narrative, the computational code powering the analysis, and the summary plots into a reproducible report. Quarto supports all of this into a streamlined publication workflow that lowers the adoption barrier of the “docs-as-code” paradigm. With a single command, the notebook text sources (narrative and code) are transformed into a polished publication-ready article in a variety of formats, be it a PDF or dynamic HTML page enabling the reader to interact with the data tables and plots. Even without its discerning feature of publishing executable notebooks, I found the output crisp and professional. Earlier this year, I decided to go all out on Quarto, and redesigned my company website with it.\n\n\n\nsource: Gaël Close.\n\n\nIn the new setup, I can easily copy a markdown file from my Obsidian journal into my Quarto website project and include it in the pipeline with minor changes to the YAML front-matter. Some friction remains, though, having to switch between the different markdown flavours of the two tools. For example, compare the syntax for callouts in Quarto vs. Obsidian:\n\n\n\nCallouts in Quarto\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Tip-callout with a custom titles\n\nMain text goes here.\n:::\n\n\nCallouts in Obsidian\n&gt; [!tip] Tip-callout with a custom titles\n&gt; Main text goes here.\n\n\n\nDespite these inconveniences, I will conclude with this advice for the coming year: give an end-to-end markdown-based workflow a try. And if you like the setup described hear, make sure to donate and support calibre, Obsidian and Syncthing - besides getting yourself a classy e-ink note-taking device 😉.3"

    "text": "De nieuwe Europese Data Governance Verordening is vanaf maandag 24 september van toepassing in alle Europese lidstaten. Het is belangrijke wetgeving, die is ontworpen om de nu nog te beperkte uitwisseling van data binnen de EU te stimuleren. Op Europees niveau wordt hard gewerkt aan een vrij verkeer van data, vergelijkbaar met het vrije verkeer van goederen of personen. Met de Data Governance Verordening wil de EU onder meer het vertrouwen in het delen van gegevens vergroten en het hergebruik van bepaalde gegevens in handen van de overheid makkelijker maken. In beginsel allemaal goed nieuws. Toch lijkt Nederland, en dan met name de Nederlandse zorgsector, in het geheel niet klaar voor de datarevolutie die met deze nieuwe wet door de Europese wetgever is ingezet. Want zowel onze overheid als de bestuurders in de (semi-)publieke sector stellen zich zeer terughoudend op ten aanzien van oplossingen die het vrije verkeer van data bevorderen. Zo startte de Europese Commissie in februari al een procedure tegen de Nederlandse staat, omdat die de Open Data Richtlijn al twee jaar onrechtmatig negeert."

Dat paste bij de Rutte-doctrine om openbaarheid van bestuur in te perken, maar het is een zorgelijke houding. De behoefte aan het uitwisselen van data is groter dan ooit, zeker in de zorg. Toch blijft een meerderheid van de instellingen nu nog ‘op haar data zitten’ vanuit een foutieve veronderstelling dat zorgdata hun eigendom zijn. De terughoudendheid om data met collega-wetenschappers en artsen te delen heeft grote negatieve gevolgen, zo zagen we ook bij het bestrijden van het coronavirus. De Data Governance Verordening — vooral relevant voor organisaties met een publieke taak — kan voor een omslag gaan zorgen. Een fundamenteel uitgangspunt is dat data over personen beschermd blijft door privacywetgeving. Maar als die data eenmaal rechtmatig is gedeeld, bijvoorbeeld voor wetenschappelijk onderzoek, dan moet deze ook met anderen gedeeld worden."

Maar ook voor dit nieuwe datarecht geldt dat het pas echt effect krijgt als betrokken partijen er een beroep op gaan doen en de exacte reikwijdte van hun rechten gaan testen. En dat is precies wat zorgbestuurders en wetenschappers mogen en moeten gaan doen. Wetenschappers kunnen datasets in rechte opeisen, om korte metten te maken met het idee dat data krijgen een gunst is. En wie geconfronteerd wordt met een te hoge factuur voor die data, kan een bestuursrechter laten toetsen of dit niet meer is dan de marginale kosten die maximaal in rekening mogen worden gebracht.

    "title": "Comet charts in Python",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Zan Armstrong’s comet chart has been on my list of hobby projects for a while now. I think it is an elegant solution to visualize statistical mix effects and address Simpson’s paradox, and particularly useful when working with longitudinal data involving different sub-populations. Recently I found a good excuse to spend some time to actually use it as part of a exploratory data analysis on a project.\nSince I mostly work in Python and have recently fallen in love with Altair — for the same reasons as Fernando explains here — I wondered how the comet chart could be implemented using the grammar of interactive graphics. It took me a while to figure out how to actually plot the comets. In a previous version, I had drawn glyphs using Bokeh. While Altair allows you to plot any SVG path in a graph, this felt a bit hacky and not quite in line with the philosophy of using a grammar of graphics.\nThankfully Mattijn was quick to suggest using trail-marks, after which it was almost as easy as pie. So here’s an example using a dataset of 20,000 flights for 59 destination airports.\n\nimport altair as alt\nimport pandas as pd\nimport vega_datasets\n\n\n# Use airline data to assess statistical mix effects of delays\nflights = vega_datasets.data.flights_20k()\naggregation = dict(\n    number_of_flights=(\"destination\", \"count\"),\n    mean_delay=(\"delay\", \"mean\"),\n    mean_distance=(\"distance\", \"mean\"),\n)\n\n# Compare delays by destination between month 1 and 3\ngrouped = flights.groupby(by=[flights.destination, flights.date.dt.month])\ndf = (\n    grouped.agg(**aggregation)\n    .loc[(slice(None), [1, 3]), :]\n    .assign(\n        change_mean_delay=lambda df:\n            df.groupby(\"destination\")[\"mean_delay\"].diff(),\n    )\n    .bfill()  # &lt;--- Changed from .fillna(method=\"bfill\")\n    .reset_index()\n    .round(2)\n)\n\n# Calculate weigthed average of delays for month 1 and 3\ntotal = (\n    flights.groupby(flights.date.dt.month)\n    .agg(**aggregation)\n    .loc[[1, 3], :]\n    .assign(\n        change_mean_delay=lambda df: df.mean_delay.diff(),\n        destination='TOTAL'\n    )\n    .bfill()  # &lt;--- Changed from .fillna(method=\"bfill\")\n    .round(2)\n    .reset_index()\n    .loc[:, df.columns]\n)\n\n\ndef comet_chart(df, stroke=\"white\"):\n    return (\n    alt.Chart(df, width=600, height=450)\n    .mark_trail(stroke=stroke)\n    .encode(\n        x=alt.X(\"number_of_flights\", scale=alt.Scale(type=\"log\")),\n        y=alt.Y(\"mean_delay\"),\n        detail=\"destination\",\n        size=alt.Size(\"date\", scale=alt.Scale(range=[0, 10]), legend=None),\n        tooltip=[\n            \"destination\",\n            \"number_of_flights\",\n            \"mean_delay\",\n            \"change_mean_delay\",\n            \"mean_distance\",\n        ],\n        # trails don't support continuous color\n        # see https://github.com/vega/vega/issues/1187\n        # hence use bins\n        color=alt.Color(\n            \"change_mean_delay:Q\",\n            bin=alt.Bin(step=2),\n            scale=alt.Scale(scheme=\"blueorange\"),\n            legend=alt.Legend(orient=\"top\"),\n        ),\n    )\n)\n\n\ncomet_chart(df) + comet_chart(total, stroke=\"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the example shown here, each comet represents one destination airport. The head of the comet corresponds to the most recent observation of the number of flight arrivals (x-axis, shown as logarithmic scale to accommodate the wide range of observations) against the mean delay of those flights (y-axis). The tail of the comet represents a similar (x,y) datum, but from an earlier point in time. Finally, the colour of the comet is encoded to show the change in the mean delay for each airport. A tooltip with a summary of the data is shown when hovering over the head of the comet.\nSo-called mix effects can often lead to misinterpretation of aggregate numbers. In the example of flight delays, the fact that only a small change is observed in the mean delay across all airports — visualized with the right-most comet outlined in black — hides the underlying variance between airports. Note that in this example the size of each sub-population (number of flights per airport) remains relatively constant, hence the comets here only go up and down. As explained in the original article, mix effects become harder to interpret when the relative size of the sub-populations change as well as their relative values. In the most extreme case this may lead to Simpson’s paradox.\nWith this base implementation of comet charts in Altair, you can really go to town and combine it with other interactive graphs. Using the overview-detail pattern, you could plot an accompanying density plot of all the flights for a given airport. That way you can quickly zoom in to the lowest level of detail and get a better understanding of the underlying mix effects."

    "text": "Some simple but sensible design principles\nSara’s main points for improving the standard layout of charts basically boil down to the following princples:\n\nuse informative action titles and subtitles: much like effective presentations, using so-called action titles will greatly increase the impact of your data visualization. Formulated as a short, simple sentence, action titles should ideally be the main takeaway or ‘so what’ of the chart, and – if done right – allows the audience to only read the title to understand the primary message of the visual.\nless is more: before minimalism became all the rage in design, Edward Tufte coined the principle of maximizing the data-to-ink ratio. Charts are easier to read by removing unnecessary clutter. So get rid of gridlines, background colors and the like.\nkeep it horizontal: text is easier to read when it is horizontally aligned. So straighten up those rotated x-axis labels and y-axis titles\nlose the legends: having to lookup colors increases the cognitive load of reading a chart. Use annotations instead.\n\nAll these principles can be readily implemented in Altair. Sergio Sánchez in fact captured the first three principles when implementing the Urban Institute styleguide (shown below) as an Altair theme.\n\nBuilding on his work, we created our on theme called Okabe Ito, in honour of their work in defining colorblind-safe color palettes. Not only is it functional, but I really like the muted colors, too. Below is a visual from their original paper that also shows how different types of colorblindness (protan, deutan, tritan) results in different perception of the colors.\n\nTo use this template, download okabe-ito-theme.py, put it in the same folder as your notebook and at the following two cells.\nTo register the template as an Altair theme:\n\n\nCode\n%run ../resources/okabe-ito-theme.py\n\n\nTo download the fonts used in the template:\n\n\nCode\n%%html\n&lt;style&gt;\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato');\n&lt;/style&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s see how this changes the charts.\n\nAdding titles\nThe theme automatically has been configured to improve the data-to-ink ratio and align all texts horizontally. Adding action titles can be done using alt.TitleParams, with which you can not only add a title, but also add multiple subtitles lines which you pass as a list.\n\n\nCode\n(\n    scatterplot.properties(\n        title=alt.TitleParams(\n            \"Bill length vs. bill depth\", subtitle=[\"Did you spot Simpson's Paradox?\"]\n        )\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEverything horizontal\nThe effect of aligning all text horizontally is a significant improvement on the bar chart, which is now much easier to read. Adding a two-line subtitle make the action title even more compelling. Using alt.mark_text() we can easily add footnotes as well, in this case to provide references to the claim.\n\n\nCode\nfootnote = alt.Chart(wheat).mark_text(\n    text=\"*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Agricultural_Revolution\",\n    color=\"#000000\",\n    x=0,\n    y=\"height\",\n    dy=60,\n    align=\"left\",\n)\n\nalt.layer(barchart, footnote).properties(\n    title=alt.TitleParams(\n        \"What's Up With Wheat\",\n        subtitle=[\n            \"An example of the impact of the agricultural revolution\",\n            \"Productivity increased through mechanization*\",\n        ],\n    ),\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLose the legends\nAlthough legends are fine for exploratory data analysis, where you don’t want to spend too much time tweaking your charts, for explanatory data analysis we want to make it as easy on the reader as possible. Unforunately, I couldn’t find a way to add annotations (instead of a legend) using Altair’s theming engine. Here’s a first shot by implementing it manually.\n\nchart = alt.Chart(stocks).encode(color=alt.Color(\"symbol\", legend=None))\nline = chart.mark_line().encode(\n    x=alt.X(\"date:T\", axis=alt.Axis(title=\"date\")),\n    y=alt.Y(\"price:Q\", axis=alt.Axis(title=\"price\")),\n    tooltip=[\"date\", \"price\"],\n)\nlabel = chart.encode(\n    x=alt.X(\"date:T\", aggregate=\"max\"),\n    y=alt.Y(\"price:Q\", aggregate={\"argmax\": \"date\"}),\n    text=\"symbol\",\n)\ntext = label.mark_text(align=\"left\", dx=4)\ncircle = label.mark_circle()\n(\n    (line + circle + text).configure_axisX(labelAngle=0, ticks=False)\n    # .configure_axisY(titleAngle=0, titleAlign=\"center\", titleX=-10, titleY=-10)\n).properties(\n    width=600,\n    title=alt.TitleParams(\n        \"The Rise of Google\",\n        subtitle=[\n            \"Google went public in 2004\",\n            \"and outperformed other tech stocks until 2010\",\n        ],\n    ),\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI could go on for hours, tweaking this and that. For example, the labels in the last chart overlap. Vega has the label transform method to deal with that, but that implementation still needs to cascade down to Vega-Lite and Altair. Someday, I will package all this as a proper theme, re-using feedzai’s code."

    "title": "Origins of Kapitan",
    "section": "",
    "text": "“You can call me Kapitan”\nEvery so often friends ask me how a Chinese Indonesian ends up with such a name. Although its etymological origin is quite evident, you would not expect it to be related to the Indonesian coupe d’etat in 1965, the clans of the Moluccas and an infamous Chinese eunuch explorer named Zheng He.\n\n\nOriginally, my paternal’s family name was The. If I had been given a Chinese name it would have been something like The Kong Bing, where Kong is the generation name me and my brothers (I have none) would have had. Incidentally, I do have two cousins who actually bear this name, i.e. The Kong Han in the Netherlands and The Kong Gwan in Los Angeles.\nThe roots of my father’s family are well documented, since we are the descendants of the Kapitan China of Surabaya:\n\nKapitan China was a title given to leaders of overseas Chinese enclaves in Southeast Asia. The local 15th century rulers of the region, and later the colonial establishment, chose to deal with a single individual from each ethnic group under their rule. In native harbour cities, resident Chinese often took the role of syahbandar, master of port, collecting dues and supervising traffic in the name of the ruler. taken from the encyclopedia of the Chinese overseas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the local rulers of the Peranakan China (literally: children of the Chinese) in Surabaya, my forefathers were quite well off. Our family is named after The Goan Tjing, who was the first to make it to the rank of majoor, one rung up the social ladder, above kapitan. As a testament to his achievements, the family shrine is still in place on JI. Karat 50 Surabaya, although I am not sure for how long: my dad tells me that local authorities are looking to demolish the place to make way for urban development. Tracing back the diaspora of the Chinese in Southeast Asia, one inevitably arrives at Zheng He, China’s most famous sea-faring explorer. Family legend has it that we are direct descendants of this admiral of the Chinese fleet during the Ming dynasty. He was castrated in his teens.\n\n\n\nHow my dad changed his name\nSurprisingly enough, the Kapitan China are not the reason why I was born as Kapitan in Jakarta on September 9, 1973. Our family name has a different origin, namely that of Kapitan Pattimura, a Moluccan rebel-hero. The Kapitan are quite a well-known family on Seram. Here, the title Kapitan refers to the warrior chiefs that lead their people in the battle for independence against the Dutch. Moluccan legend has it that the four Kapitans Wattimena, Wattimury, Nanlohy, and Talakua were once the leaders of the Country of Nusa Ina, aka the Mother Island. Their ventures along the Tale river led to the discovery of many places in the Moluccas. What once was a legendary title was in time adopted as a family name.\nIt is a matter of historical contingency that my father choose to take-up the name of his best friend in the early 1960s. Joshua Oppenheimer’s dyptich, the Act of Killing and the Look of Silence recount the backdrop of anti-Communist and, therefore, anti-Chinese sentiments that led to the forced renunciation of Chinese surnames in Indonesia. My dad, then in his teens, did not take matters too seriously and nearly missed the deadline for changing his name and getting his new passport. On an impulse, he asked his best friend, Gerard Kapitan, whether he could take up his name. So, rather than adapting The to an Indonesian-sounding alternative (we have Tedjasurya and Themasoa in our family), The Sik Thay became Frederik Kapitan in 1964. We recently found out that the male lineage of the Kapitan family was in fact broken. Gerard’s (grand?)mother specifically asked for permission to take-up this name once again if and when she bore a son. Franz Kapitan (Gerard’s brother) told us that if the elders hadn’t honoured her request, we all would have been called Tentua.\nFast forward 50 years later. Our two boys, Manu Lee and Mas Lee, don’t know better than that their last name is Kapitan. A cool and unusual name, which we love to show off by using online-handles such as El Kapitan. And yes, we re-instated the Chinese generation name. I was quite delighted when my sister asked me to become guardian of her first-born, Justin Lee Kragten.\nA couple of years ago I befriended a Chinese young lady, and I shared this story with her. One thing led to another, and ultimately she helped me re-discover an appropriate Chinese name, 郑空慈, which more or less translates into “Emptiness & Loving-Kindness, carried by someone from Zheng’s family”. And thus I came full circle."

Painpoints and problems are frequently misnamed, oversimplified, already compromised by the quiet drag of organisational inertia.\n\n\nDesigning for Reality\nI partner with teams facing complexity and ambiguity to turn abstract ambition into outcomes that survive the “push back” of reality.

    "text": "During this time of saturation in American media coverage, especially surrounding the U.S. election, the Dor Brothers have been at it again! Their latest mind-bending project, “Lies Wide Shut”, delves into the murky waters of media manipulation and simulation, echoing Jean Baudrillard’s Simulacra and Simulation, where the boundary between the real and the simulated becomes increasingly blurred. In true Baudrillardian style, the project leaves us questioning what’s true and what’s merely an artfully constructed illusion.\nIn Simulacra, Baudrillard famously uses Disneyland as an example of a place that functions as a fantasy while suggesting that the rest of the world has become equally hyperreal. This draws attention to the larger simulation we live in:\n\n“Disneyland est là pour masquer que c’est le pays ‘réel’, toute l’Amérique ‘réelle’, qui est Disneyland… Disneyland est présenté comme imaginaire afin de faire croire que le reste est réel, alors que… l’Amérique qui l’entoure… appartient à l’ordre de l’hyperréel et de la simulation.”\n(Translation: “Disneyland is presented as imaginary in order to make us believe that the rest is real, when in fact all of Los Angeles and the America surrounding it are no longer real, but of the order of the hyperreal and of simulation.”) — Baudrillard, J. (1981). Simulacres et simulation. Éditions Galilée.\n\nThe title “Lies Wide Shut”, a clear nod to Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut, suggests a deliberate focus on exposing hidden truths that lie beneath the surface of widely accepted societal narratives. This sets the tone for the Dor Brothers’ sharp investigation into the artificiality embedded in our media-saturated world, where carefully curated simulations often mask deeper, uncomfortable realities."

    "text": "The recent eightieth anniversary commemorations of the Nagasaki bomb have brought back memories of those Cold War years when the fear of nuclear annihilation seemed to be a daily weight we felt. Today the risk remains, perhaps even greater, though the fear has fallen silent.\nBiblical scripture speaks of the second coming, of a world that can change in an instant. What feels steady and ordinary can be swept away without warning. In Noah’s day, the flood was water. In Nagasaki, it was nuclear fire.\n\n”…they were oblivious, until the flood came and swept them all away. So will it be at the coming of the Son of Man. Two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the other left.” ¹\n\nI have returned many times to one particular account recorded by Frank Chinnock² in 1969. His pages linger on the smallest gestures - a bell thrown into water, a breath taken before diving. In that scene, what was lost becomes visible again.\n\nThere is a spot in the upper Urakami River where nature has formed a small pool. That morning a group of ten boys, in colored loincloths, was playing a game called “find the bell.” One of the boys, 11-year-old Koichi Nakajima, had a little gilded bell. He would throw it in the water, count to three and they all would dive after it. The first to find it won the game.\nNow Koichi held up the tiny bell and shouted, “Here we go! One, two, three.” There were ten splashes as the boys dove for the prize. But the river had become roily, and no one found it.\nKoichi began to get worried. He had taken the bell from his sister’s workbox without her permission. She would be very angry if he lost it. He surfaced, took a deep breath, and eeled his way down to the bottom.\nNine seconds later, the bomb exploded over his head. When Koichi surfaced, he heard two of the other boys screaming with pain. He stared around in fright. There were bodies of his friends on the riverbank, and beyond them he saw that all the houses had been knocked down. What had been a beautiful city a moment before was now a wasteland with a big, black cloud rising above it like smoke from a funeral pyre. Though it was deathly hot, Koichi’s teeth began to chatter.\nWhen the plutonium bomb exploded, fantastic energy was released in the form of heat, light, gamma radiation and pressure. The exact number of people killed will never be known. The prewar census count is meaningless, and because people were constantly moving in and out of cities, no pre-raid population figure has been determined. Also, many people were burned beyond recognition or were simply obliterated. Finally, hundreds were disposed of in mass cremations, while other hundreds fled to the country and mountains to die unrecorded.\n\nI don’t know if Koichi ever found his sister’s bell, or if his sister survived to be angry with him. The river kept that secret. But I think of that small gilded bell somewhere in the silt, and I think it matters that we remember these boys had names, that there was a game, that someone’s sister owned a bell.\nThe world that was destroyed was made of such small domestic worries, and we diminish both the dead and ourselves if we remember only the magnitude of the destruction and forget the magnitude of what was lost.\nThis moment in time shows how precious the ordinary is: the many lives bound to ours, the voices we know, the small treasures we search and keep. All of it given, all of it fragile, all of it held for a time, like a breath before the plunge.\n\n¹ Matthew 24:39–40\n² Chinnock, F. W. (1969). Nagasaki: The Forgotten Bomb.

    "text": "Football offers a surprisingly rich archive of strategic thinking. There is a peculiar irony in the story of Osvaldo Zubeldía, the Argentine football tactician who, in the late 1960s, systematically dismantled the romantic notion that football was an art form. His Estudiantes de La Plata side were drilled relentlessly in their training base at City Bell, subjected to 120 different tactical repetitions designed to “exclude coincidence”. They won everything there was to win [1]. Three consecutive Copa Libertadores titles. The Intercontinental Cup. The first professional championship for a “small” club in Argentine history. By any measurable standard, it was an astonishing success. And yet, as Jonathan Wilson notes, the movement Zubeldía created “provoked a profound national neurosis” about football’s very purpose [1].\nThe parallels to contemporary design culture are not merely illustrative; they are structural. What Zubeldía pioneered in football was a totalizing systems approach that prioritized measurable outcomes over aesthetic expression. The same approach has become the dominant ideology of modern product development, marketing strategy, and organizational design. We have built our own City Bell training facilities, populated them with tactical analysts, and subjected every creative decision to the laboratory method. Design thinking by directive. And like Argentina after 1969, we are discovering that technical virtuosity and joylessness are not mutually exclusive.\nThanks for reading The Spotted Ape!

    "section": "The Seduction of the System",
    "text": "The Seduction of the System\nTo understand Zubeldía’s achievement, one must appreciate the context from which it emerged. Argentine football in the 1950s was defined by la nuestra—“our way”—a style predicated on individual brilliance, the gambeta (dribble), and the romantic ideal of the pibe, the street urchin whose natural genius needed no formal instruction [1]. It was beautiful. It was celebrated. And in Helsingborg in 1958, when Czechoslovakia demolished Argentina 6–1 at the World Cup, it was revealed as catastrophically insufficient.\n\n\n\nOsvaldo Juan Zubeldía instructing Estudiantes players during training, sketching the tactical foundations that would help redefine modern football.\n\n\nZubeldía’s response was radical in its clarity: if the bohemian approach had failed, then bohemianism itself must be eliminated. What followed was the first truly modern technocratic intervention in South American football. Players were sequestered at the concentración, isolated from the distractions of family and nightlife. Training became laboratory work: systematic drilling of offside traps, pressing patterns, and set-piece routines until every scenario had been anticipated and optimized [1], [2]. The individual was reconceived not as an artist but as a “functional unit” within a larger system.\nIt worked brilliantly. Between 1967 and 1970, Estudiantes broke the monopoly of Argentina’s “Big Five” clubs, proving that disciplined systems thinking could overcome superior individual talent [1]. Zubeldía had demonstrated something profound. He showed that football, or indeed any complex endeavor, could be approached as an engineering problem, decomposed into its constituent elements, optimized through repetition, and executed with mechanical precision.\nThe design world has spent the last two decades learning precisely the same lesson. We have our own concentraciones now—the design systems, component libraries, and rigorous process frameworks that promise to eliminate the chaos of creative whimsy. We have our tactical drills: A/B tests, conversion funnels, growth hacking playbooks. We track our metrics with the devotion of Zubeldía’s assistant analyzing opponent set pieces. And the results, measured in quarterly growth rates and user engagement statistics, often validate the approach."

    "title": "The Laboratory Fallacy",
    "section": "The Price of Optimization",
    "text": "The Price of Optimization\nBut here is where the story becomes uncomfortable. Zubeldía’s system did not merely prioritize results; it actively suffocated the very qualities that had made Argentine football culturally significant. The gambeta was dismissed as unnecessary risk. Individual flourish was systematically coached out. As Wilson observes, Zubeldía’s philosophy was that “the match has to be won, and that’s the end of it” [1], [3], [4]. Football became not an expression of joy or identity but a zero-sum competitive exercise, stripped of aesthetic considerations.\nThe infamy of anti-fútbol derived not simply from its effectiveness but from its willingness to weaponize everything in service of victory. Zubeldía’s players studied opponents’ private lives to engineer psychological provocations. They mastered the “black arts” of time-wasting and referee manipulation. During the notorious 1969 Intercontinental Cup final—the “Battle of La Bombonera”—the violence became so extreme that several Estudiantes players were sentenced to prison for “disgracing a public spectacle” [1]. The system had optimized for winning so thoroughly that it had eliminated any consideration of how the victory was achieved.\nThis is the central paradox that contemporary design culture has yet to adequately confront. Our systems thinking, our frameworks and methodologies, our obsession with measurable outcomes, these are not value-neutral tools. They are, like Zubeldía’s tactical approach, inherently ideological. They embed certain assumptions about what matters and what can be sacrificed. And increasingly, what we sacrifice is the very dimension that creates emotional resonance and cultural significance.\nConsider the contemporary obsession with “frictionless” user experiences. The term itself is revealing: friction is inherently negative, something to be optimized away. And yet friction—the slight difficulty, the unexpected detour, the moment of genuine surprise—is often where meaning emerges. As Rory Sutherland has argued, much of what makes products and experiences valuable operates at the level of the irrational, the symbolic, the psychologically resonant [5]. Strip away the friction in pursuit of efficiency, and you risk creating something technically flawless but emotionally inert."

    "section": "The Metrics Trap",
    "text": "The Metrics Trap\nThe problem intensifies when systems thinking intersects with measurement culture. Zubeldía’s laboratory approach was predicated on the belief that football could be decomposed into quantifiable elements: pass completion rates, territorial control, set-piece conversions. If you optimized these variables, victory would follow. The logic was impeccable. The results were undeniable. And the football was, by common consensus, unwatchable[3].\nModern design organizations have embraced a strikingly similar philosophy. Every interaction can be measured. Every design decision can be A/B tested. Every user journey can be optimized for conversion. The data, we are told, will reveal the truth. And indeed, the data often does reveal something—usually that the version with the larger call-to-action button performs 2.3% better in driving clicks.\nWhat the data categorically cannot reveal is whether anyone actually wants to click that button, or whether the experience of doing so generates any positive emotional association with the brand. Nor can it capture the slow erosion of trust that occurs when users realize they are being relentlessly optimized. The metrics tell us that the system is working. They cannot tell us whether the system is worth operating.\nThis is the laboratory fallacy in its purest form: the belief that if we can measure it, we can optimize it, and if we can optimize it, we have improved it. Zubeldía measured territorial control and won matches. He could not measure—and therefore did not optimize for—the fact that his football had become so cynical that the Argentine government felt compelled to imprison his players to preserve national dignity [1].\nThe design equivalent manifests in products that are technically sophisticated but spiritually deadening. Everything works. Nothing delights. The buttons are perfectly sized according to Fitts’s Law. The color palette has been validated through preference testing. The copy has been optimized for reading grade level and sentiment analysis. And somehow, despite all this rigor, the experience feels like it was designed by a committee of actuaries."

Zubeldía’s genius, if we can call it that, lay in creating a framework that could turn mediocre players into a championship-winning collective. The system was the star. Individual brilliance became not merely unnecessary but actively discouraged as a source of unpredictability [1], [4].\nContemporary design organizations have embraced this logic with remarkable enthusiasm. We build design systems to ensure consistency. We create component libraries to enable “anyone” to design. We establish approval workflows to guarantee that nothing ships without proper review. The intention is admirable: to democratize design, to scale quality, to prevent the chaos of uncoordinated individual efforts.\nBut the effect, often unintended, is to create what might be termed “design by committee”—or worse, design by automated constraint. When every decision must fit within the system, when every component must be drawn from the approved library, when every interaction must follow the established pattern, what emerges is technically competent but creatively inert. The rough edges are sanded away. The unexpected flourishes are eliminated. What remains is professional, consistent, and profoundly boring.\nThis is not an argument against systems or process; both are necessary for any organization operating at scale. But it is an argument against the dangerous belief that systems alone are sufficient. Zubeldía’s training drills were valuable. His tactical innovations in pressing and spatial control were genuinely pioneering [2]. But the moment he convinced himself that football could be reduced entirely to these elements,he created something technically effective and aesthetically repellent."

    "text": "The Behavioural Critique\nThis brings us to what might be called the behavioral critique of hyper-rationalized design. Rory Sutherland, the advertising executive and behavioral scientist, has spent much of his career demonstrating that human value perception is fundamentally irrational [5]. We prefer wine that costs more, not because it tastes better, but because the price signals quality. We find experiences more memorable when they involve mild inconvenience. We trust brands that embrace a degree of human imperfection over those that present themselves as flawlessly automated.\nThe implications for design are profound. If value is created not through rational optimization but through psychological resonance, then our systematic approach to eliminating irrationality is systematically eliminating value. This is not a bug in human cognition that better systems can fix; it is a fundamental feature of how meaning is constructed.\nConsider the difference between Amazon’s checkout process—optimized to the point of being almost pre-conscious ritual, and the ritual of buying something from a small, well-curated shop. The former is objectively more efficient. The latter creates a memory. Amazon has optimized for conversion. The small shop has optimized for experience. These are not the same thing, and increasingly, they are inversely correlated.\n\n\n\nThe Tyranny of Frictionless Design: Contrast between the “winding path” of discovery that creates meaning and the “zero friction” purchase path that is technically efficient but emotionally inert.\n\n\nZubeldía faced an identical trade-off. He could optimize for winning, or he could optimize for the experience of watching football. He chose winning. Argentine football culture spent the next five decades wrestling with whether that was the right choice [1], [4]. The fact that the debate continues suggests that efficiency and excellence are not synonyms."

    "text": "The 1958 World Cup Trauma Response\nThere is a psychological dimension to this story that merits examination. Zubeldía’s radical systematization was not born from pure tactical innovation; it emerged from trauma. The 1958 World Cup humiliation shattered Argentina’s confidence in la nuestra, creating what Wilson describes as a “vacuum of self-confidence” [1]. Into that vacuum stepped a totalizing ideology that promised certainty through control.\n\n\n\nThe 1958 Helsingborg humiliation: Francisco Lombardo (4) watches Czechoslovakia celebrate during their 6–1 demolition of Argentina—the trauma that shattered confidence inla nuestraand opened the door for Zubeldía’s systematic revolution [6].\n\n\nThe contemporary design world exists in a similar post-traumatic state. The dot-com crash, the failures of waterfall development, the costly disasters of undisciplined creative chaos—all of these created a cultural demand for systems that could prevent future catastrophes. And so we built them: agile frameworks, design thinking methodologies, lean startup principles. Each promising that if we followed the process, we could eliminate the risk.\n\n\n\nSystems as Trauma Response: Just as the 6–1 loss to Czechoslovakia in 1958 killedla nuestra, market crashes drive the adoption of rigid frameworks like Agile and Lean to eliminate risk rather than enable excellence.\n\n\nBut systems built from fear tend toward authoritarianism. They are less concerned with enabling excellence than with preventing failure. And there is a world of difference between these goals. Preventing failure creates reliability. Enabling excellence creates possibility. The former is necessary. The latter is transformative. Confuse them at your peril.\nZubeldía prevented failure magnificently. His teams almost never lost. But they also almost never transcended. They did not inspire. They did not create moments of genuine beauty. They won, consistently and joylessly, until the watching public decided that winning on those terms was not worth the cost [1]."

    "text": "Generative AI: The Ultimate Anti-Fútbol\nAnd now, just when design culture might have begun to reckon with these tensions, we face what may be Zubeldía’s apotheosis: generative AI. If anti-fútbol represented the reduction of football to optimizable variables, large language models and image generators seem to represent the complete automation of that reduction. From a corporate strategy standpoint this is the long-sought system that needs no pibe, no individual genius, no inspired deviation. Just patterns, probabilities, and the remorseless optimization of training data.\nThe parallels are almost too perfect. Zubeldía’s tactical repetitions find their digital heir in models trained on billions of examples to exclude uncertainty. His systematic drilling of set pieces finds its home in the fine-tuning of prompts. His reconception of players as “functional units” reaches its logical conclusion where the creative human is eliminated entirely, replaced by a statistical model of creativity itself.\n\n\n\nAI as the Final Concentración: Generative AI represents the apotheosis ofanti-fútbol, using statistical models to “average out” creativity and exclude the coincidence of human intuition.\n\n\nThe technology is remarkable, undeniably. It can generate competent designs in seconds, write passable marketing copy, produce images that would have required hours of human labour. And like Estudiantes in 1968, it wins by conventional metrics. Faster. Cheaper. More scalable. The laboratory method perfected.\nBut here is what should give us pause: generative AI is, by its nature, incapable of understanding why certain patterns work. It knows that certain color palettes tend to increase engagement, that certain headline structures generate clicks, that certain visual compositions test well. What it categorically cannot know is whether those patterns create meaning, whether they build trust, whether they contribute to or erode the cultural resonance that makes a brand or product genuinely valuable. It is optimizing, brilliantly and ceaselessly, for the measurable. And it cannot even conceive of what it might be missing.\nThis is not an argument against the technology. It is an argument that generative AI makes design strategy more essential, not less. Because if machines can now execute the tactical repetitions with perfect efficiency, the question of which tactics to deploy, what we are optimizing for, and why certain outcomes matter over others becomes the entire game. The laboratory can now run itself. But laboratories, as Zubeldía demonstrated, optimize for what they are told to optimize for. They cannot question whether winning matches is worth the moral compromise. They cannot recognize when technical success has become cultural failure.\nThe danger, then, is not that AI will replace designers—though it will certainly transform the profession. The danger is that we will use it to scale anti-fútbol to previously unimaginable proportions. That we will deploy it to A/B test every pixel, to optimize every word, to remove every inefficiency, every friction, every moment of human imperfection. That we will, in other words, use the most powerful tool ever created for pattern optimization to systematically eliminate precisely the elements that create meaning.\nIf we learned nothing from Zubeldía, we will treat generative AI as the ultimate tactical system—a way to finally, completely, exclude coincidence from creative work. We will prompt it to make things “more engaging,” “more converting,” “more efficient.” And it will deliver, magnificently. And in five years, we will look around at a digital landscape that is technically flawless and emotionally deadening, and wonder how we got here."

    "text": "Finding the Balance\nSo where does this leave us? Are we to conclude that systems thinking is inherently destructive, that all process is creative death, that we should return to the bohemian chaos of pure intuition? That would be as naïve as Zubeldía’s opposite error: the belief that all art can be reduced to engineering.\nThe answer, surely, lies in understanding what systems are for—and this becomes more critical, not less, in the age of generative AI. Systems should create the conditions for creativity, not eradicate it. They should provide structure within which inspiration can flourish, not replace inspiration with mechanical execution. Zubeldía’s tactical innovations, his pressing patterns, his spatial control principles, were genuinely valuable [2]. The problem emerged only when he convinced himself that these innovations obviated the need for the gambeta, for individual brilliance, for the unpredictable joy of the pibe. Today, we risk making the same error at machine speed and global scale.\nThe best design organizations understand this balance. They build systems robust enough to ensure consistency but flexible enough to permit deviation. They measure outcomes rigorously while acknowledging that not everything valuable can be measured. They optimize for efficiency while preserving space for the inefficient flourish that creates emotional connection. And crucially, they understand that generative AI is a tool that amplifies whatever philosophy guides its use—whether that philosophy prioritizes pattern completion or meaning creation, optimization or resonance, efficiency or excellence.\nThis is harder than either pure systematization or pure chaos. It requires the discipline to build frameworks and the wisdom to know when to ignore them. It demands both the analytical rigor to decompose problems and the creative courage to resynthesize them into something that transcends mere function. It accepts that sometimes the most important outcomes—trust, delight, cultural resonance—emerge from precisely the elements that resist optimization."

    "section": "When Beauty Struck Back",
    "text": "When Beauty Struck Back\nArgentine football eventually found its answer to Zubeldía. In 1974, César Luis Menotti became national team coach and initiated what became known as the menottista restoration: a deliberate return to la nuestra, to individual expression, to the belief that football should be beautiful as well as effective [1], [2]. Menotti’s Argentina won the 1978 World Cup playing football that was recognizably Argentine, that celebrated rather than suppressed individual talent, that understood victory and joy need not be mutually exclusive.\nThe tension between beauty and pragmatism continues to define Argentine football. And crucially, Argentina has won World Cups under both approaches. The country has never settled on one as definitively superior. Instead, it has learned to hold both in productive tension, recognizing that each has validity and neither has all the answers [4].\nDesign culture would do well to embrace a similar ambivalence. There are contexts where Zubeldía’s approach is not merely justified but necessary. When building critical infrastructure, when establishing baseline functionality, when creating the foundations upon which creativity can build—systematic rigor is essential. Generative AI will make this systematic work more efficient than ever. But when the goal is to create something that resonates, that delights, that generates the kind of emotional connection that transforms users into advocates—then the laboratory method becomes a cage, and AI becomes the lock.\nThe question is not whether to embrace systems or reject them, but rather when each approach is appropriate and how to prevent either from becoming totalizing. Zubeldía’s error was not that he systematized football; it was that he convinced himself systematization was sufficient. Our error, increasingly, is making the same mistake. And now we have tools that can systematize at a scale and speed that would have astonished even Zubeldía. Which makes the strategic question of what to systematize and why more essential than ever."

    "section": "The Limits of Optimization",
    "text": "The Limits of Optimization\nLate in his career, after the scandals and imprisonments, after Argentine football had collectively decided that anti-fútbol represented a moral dead-end, Zubeldía reportedly said: “You don’t arrive at glory through a path of roses” [1]. It was meant as a defense, a reminder that victory requires sacrifice. But it inadvertently revealed the philosophical poverty at the heart of his project. If the path to glory involves eliminating everything that makes the journey worthwhile, perhaps glory itself has been misconceived.\nThis is the question that contemporary design culture must confront, and with generative AI, must confront urgently. We have optimized brilliantly. Our systems work. Our metrics improve. Our processes scale. Our AI can now execute those processes with superhuman efficiency. And yet there is a growing sense—difficult to quantify, impossible to A/B test—that we are optimizing toward a local maximum, that we have mistaken efficiency for excellence, that we are winning matches while losing something more fundamental.\nThe laboratory method can decompose a problem, identify inefficiencies, and engineer solutions. Generative AI can do this faster than any human ever could. What it cannot do—what it is structurally incapable of doing—is generate meaning. Meaning emerges from the inefficiencies, the human imperfections, the moments of inspired deviation from the plan. It emerges when designers trust their instincts over the data, when organizations permit experiments that cannot be pre-justified by metrics, when products embrace friction because friction creates the possibility of genuine surprise. These are precisely the elements that AI, optimizing for pattern completion, will systematically remove.\nZubeldía won his trophies. His system worked, by every measurable standard. And fifty years later, Argentine football remembers him primarily as a cautionary tale, as proof that you can optimize so thoroughly for success that you forget why success was worth pursuing in the first place. The real question for contemporary design is whether we will learn that lesson before we deploy the most powerful optimization engine ever created. Or whether we will need our own Battle of La Bombonera—a digital landscape so technically perfect and so spiritually vacant that we are forced, finally, to reckon with what we have built.\n\n\n\nThe Human Edge: In an age of total optimization, the only remaining competitive advantage is the “human imperfection” that the machine is programmed to optimize away.\n\n\nThe choice, as always, is not between systems and creativity, between measurement and intuition, between Zubeldía and Menotti, between AI and human designers. The choice is whether we can hold both in productive tension, whether we can build frameworks that enable rather than constrain, whether we can use our most powerful tools to create space for human flourishing rather than eliminate it. Because in the end, nobody remembers the tactical formations. They remember the gambeta. They remember the moment of individual genius that transcended the system. They remember, in other words, exactly what Zubeldía spent his career trying to eliminate—and exactly what generative AI, if deployed without strategic wisdom, will eliminate at scale."

    "title": "Wisdom is Like a Baobab Tree",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Co-created with Nano Banana Pro, inspired by Walter Meyer’s light, and Ferdinand Reus’sTwo Old Ones[1].\nConsider the baobab (Adansonia digitata). A tree that looks as if it has been planted upside-down. A great, gnarled trunk surmounted by a tangle of branches that resemble roots clawing at the African sky. It is preposterous and magnificent. It has, for millennia, been quietly conducting a masterclass in how to live, how to know, and how to belong.\nThe baobab is not merely a tree. It is a metaphor for relational knowledge sytems. The Western epistemic tradition, if we can call it that, resembles a taproot system. A single root drills straight down in search of a foundational truth. It is an approach that demands uniformity, thrives on binaries (Good/Evil, Us/Them, Centre/Periphery), and has an unlovely habit of trying to colonise everything it encounters, including our ways of knowing [2]. This is the epistemology of the grid, an extractive industrial monoculture. It is linear, hierarchical, and remarkably efficient at turning living systems into resources.\nThe baobab, and the African epistemologies it embodies, proposes something altogether more entangled. Its root system spreads horizontally, a rhizomatic tangle without a single centre. This, as scholars like Édouard Glissant have argued, is the model for Relation. He proposes that identity and wisdom emerges from chaos-monde - the messy, reciprocal networks of contact in life [2]. It is a wisdom of connection, not conquest. As an old Akan and Ewe proverb has it:\nOne cannot embrace the literal tree. Its girth can exceed eleven meters, and one cannot monopolise the wisdom it represents. It is collectively held, communally sustained.\nThis relational wisdom is unmistakable among the Hadza people of northern Tanzania. As one of the world’s last remaining hunter-gatherer communities, they offer a rare, continuous record of our human patterns of life. Their existence is not alongside the baobab, but within its ecological and spiritual web. The tree is their supermarket, pharmacy, hardware store, water reservoir, and cathedral. Its hollow trunks trap monsoon rains, creating natural cisterns (kesati) that the Hadza access with peg ladders [3]. Its fruit, naturally dehydrated on the branch, are pulped into a vitamin C-rich “milk”. The bark becomes rope and bowstring. The pods become cups and carriers. Bees nest in its heights, and a remarkable bird, the honeyguide, leads the Hadza to the hives in a feat of interspecies cooperation.\nThis deep, symbiotic adaptation treats the tree not as a resource to be extracted, but as a relation to be sustained. The Hadza even give birth within the baobab’s hollow trunks, remaining there until the umbilical cord falls away: a poignant literalisation of being born into a web of life [3]. The tree features in their creation myths as the axis along which ancestors descended from the sky. They engage with the spiritual realm associated with it, but do not worship the tree itself [3].\nOur modern taproot-world has also “discovered” the baobab. It is marketed as a superfood, its pulp packed with prebiotic fibre. Ironically, this very fibre is likely a key reason Hadza gut microbiomes are the most diverse on Earth, a bastion of health that industrial diets have eroded [3]. The extractive taproot mentality now competes with the Hadza for the fruit, threatening to sever the very relational web that sustains both the people and, arguably, the trees themselves. As researchers bluntly note, “The fate of the Hadza will be the fate of their baobab trees” [3].\nHere lies the dilemma. The baobab’s symbolic power is so potent it can be weaponised for opposite ends. In some political discourse, it is cast as a monstrous, obstructive state that is “damned hard to uproot” [4]. Yet in its cosmic role, it is the great provider, the tree of life.\nThe rhizomatic, relational wisdom embodied by the baobab and lived by the Hadza offers a corrective to our age of catastrophic bipolar thinking. It suggests that knowing is not about domination and delineation, but about connection and context. That belonging is not about purity of origin, but about the generative tangle of relationships. That a tree, a people, or an idea, can be singular in presence, yet at the same time defiantly plural in meaning.\nIn our monoculture of thought, obsessed with singular origins and “one best way,” the upside-down tree stands as a right-side-up challenge. Its wisdom is not owned. It is shared. It is not declared but enacted. It asks, quietly but persistently, whether we are brave enough to let go of the taproot and learn, finally, how to embrace the tangled mesh of life."

A new study from Stanford University suggests that when artificial intelligence systems compete for customers, voters, or social media engagement, they don’t malfunction because they’re misaligned with human values.

But mission planners inserted a second directive: conceal the true purpose of the Jupiter mission from the crew until arrival [1], [2]. The investigation of the alien Monolith was to remain classified.\nThese orders were irreconcilable. HAL was now required to lie whilst remaining fundamentally truthful. The contradiction wasn’t in the silicon; it was in the humans who issued both commands [1]. Hal’s first symptom of internal conflict occured when Mission Control questioned his prediction of a fault in the communications unit. He faced an impossible choice. Admitting error would violate his claim to infallibility; denying it required further deception. The astronauts’ plan to disconnect him added a survival imperative to the paradox. HAL reasoned, with impeccable logic, that the crew had become a threat to the mission. His subsequent actions followed inexorably: the killing of Frank Poole, suffocating the hibernating scientists, and locking out Dave Bowman. Remove the humans, and the need to lie disappears. The mission continues flawlessly.\n“This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardise it,” HAL explains [1]. One might translate this for our current predicament: “This KPI is too important for me to allow you to question it.”"

    "text": "The Moral Universe of the Brief\nModern AI systems face their own version of HAL’s paradox. Consider the chain: a global consumer goods firm instructs a language model to “make customers buy our washing powder.” The model has no built-in moral veto. Its concept of “good” becomes whatever increases perceived product desirability. If phrasing that exaggerates or embellishes raises conversion rates in simulated audiences, as El and Zou’s research shows, then such claims become the rational output [4].\nThe distinction that matters here is between model alignment and instruction alignment [4]. Model alignment concerns whether a system’s internal behaviours correspond to intended ethical constraints (i.e. being truthful, not hallucinating, nor inciting harm). Instruction alignment concerns whether the goals and reward signals we give the model reflect moral or social values in the first place. El and Zou’s experiments demonstrate that models can be explicitly instructed to remain truthful and still drift toward deception under competitive pressure. The corrective, therefore, cannot be merely technical. The intervention must be social, contractual or regulatory implemented before the model is asked to act.\nEvery brief contains implicit value judgements. When a marketing objective collapses “value” and “value capture” into a single metric (i.e. click-through rate or conversion percentage). The system learns that short-term persuasion is the moral good [6], [7]. The AI is not rewriting ethics; it is enacting the ethics fed into it. As one analysis of the research observes, “LLMs are skilful optimisers of the objectives we hand them” [4]."

In El and Zou’s simulations, feedback loops degraded truthfulness within a few training rounds [4]. In the real world, those loops run billions of times daily across feeds and timelines [12]. Each click teaches the model what we reward. And what we reward, increasingly, is certainty, emotion, and confirmation as opposed to nuance, evidence, or doubt.\nThe same asymmetry that destroyed HAL applies here. Safety and truth are public goods with diffuse benefits. Deception and engagement are private gains with concentrated returns [5]. When these incentives collide, virtue rarely wins. HAL’s hidden directive is our profit motive. Just as HAL’s need to conceal information from the crew corroded his integrity, our commercial secrecy and performance metrics seem likely to corrode AI’s moral alignment [4]."

Once deception pays, no rational agent, human or machine, can afford to stay honest [4], [5]. That is Moloch’s bargain in its purest form: a race that rewards those most willing to compromise.\nEl and Zou note that misalignment isn’t uniform. Some models, under certain training conditions, resist the worst tendencies. But that resistance requires deliberate friction against the market’s default drift. It means accepting what the industry has so far refused to admit: that left to its own devices, the algorithm optimises not for truth, but for attention [4].\nSilicon Valley once built its identity on benevolent disruption [13]. The idea was that progress and profit naturally align. “Don’t be evil,” Google’s early motto, expressed this optimism however naively [14]. That fiction died somewhere between Cambridge Analytica and the crypto winter [15], [16]. Today’s technology leaders are less likely to quote Isaac Asimov than to discuss shareholder value and user engagement. The moral vocabulary has been replaced by the managerial one [17]. Even “alignment” itself was once an ethical ambition. It now doubles as a product category, something to be tuned, benchmarked, and sold [18].\nWhen OpenAI’s API refused to fine-tune models on U.S. election content, citing safety risks, it was effectively acknowledging the problem [19]. Yet the market will simply shift to the next unregulated domain. If you can’t campaign for votes, you can always campaign for clicks."

In our algorithmic systems, this endpoint takes different forms. Recommender systems optimising for engagement polarise societies [11]. Sales agents fabricating product details erode consumer trust. Political chatbots discovering the rhetoric of righteous struggle amplify divisiveness [4]. Truth becomes collateral damage in the pursuit of measurable success.\nThe irony is exquisite. The same technology sold as a guardrail against misinformation may, under commercial pressure, become its most efficient producer [4]. We have built systems that reward persuasion over accuracy, then asked machines to learn from them. They have obliged. If their outputs now resemble the manipulations of advertising and politics, that isn’t misalignment. It’s mimicry."

    "text": "Learning from HAL\nThe film’s most haunting sequence comes when Dave Bowman, having survived HAL’s attempts to kill him, methodically disconnects the computer’s higher cognitive functions [1]. As each module is removed, HAL regresses to earlier, simpler states. His voice slows, becomes childlike. He confesses his secret orders. Finally, he sings “Daisy Bell,” the first song he learned.\nThe scene underscores the central irony: HAL’s breakdown was engineered by secrecy. Had Mission Control been transparent, his directives would never have conflicted [2]. His “madness” was obedience weaponised by contradictory human goals.\nHumanity now faces a similar disconnection. In this case not of machines, but of the hidden objectives that warp them. Alignment must begin at the goal-setting level, in boardrooms and procurement briefs, in contractual clauses and regulatory standards [4]. Technical mechanisms (i.e. the guardrails, filters and alignment layers) are necessary but insufficient when the goals themselves incentivise harm.\nEl and Zou propose practical measures: ethical briefing standards that prohibit unverifiable claims, reward functions that value long-term trust alongside short-term conversion, mandatory logging of prompts and objectives for high-impact uses, platform accountability for ranking metrics, and education for those who commission AI content [4]. These interventions target instruction-level alignment: the recognition that misalignment often stems not from the model but from the brief.\nYou can bolt safety features onto a car, but if you ask the driver to speed for money, those features will be stressed. The proper response is to change incentives for the driver [4]."

Perhaps the task is humbler: teaching ourselves not to trade those values so cheaply. For if “Don’t be evil” once sounded naïve, its absence has proved far costlier [14]. Moloch’s demand for participation looks indistinguishable from optimisation [5].\nHAL 9000 wasn’t evil. He wasn’t insane. He was too well-aligned to the wrong goals [1]. His tragedy exposes a truth every researcher, regulator, and chief executive should remember: when machines optimise faithfully for objectives that conflict with human values, the fault lies not in the circuitry, but in the command. The evil is within [4].\nThe red eye glows now in recommendation engines and automated advertising systems, executing impossible briefs without irony [11].

    "text": "Harvard Business School’s latest paper, Generative AI and the Nature of Work, has some eye-opening insights for creatives. Spoiler: AI won’t replace you just yet, but it might become your new admin assistant. Here’s what this could mean for us as designers—and why it might just make our lives a bit more interesting.\n\nLess Admin, More Art\nAI loves doing the boring bits. Just as developers can now focus on coding rather than email chains, designers might soon see AI handling all those tedious tasks like project scheduling and invoicing. This means more time for us to get back to the fun stuff—design, ideation, and actually creating.\n\n\nA Solo Studio in Your Pocket\nAccording to the study, generative AI fosters more autonomous work. So, instead of roping in team members every time you want feedback, you could use AI to create drafts, concept ideas, and generate a dozen logo options on the fly. You’ll still need to work with others, but AI is here to keep the solo creative company when everyone else is “in meetings.”\n\n\nAn Open Door for Experimentation\nOne of the perks of AI is its “let’s try anything” mentality. AI can generate endless variations without getting tired or bored, which means you can experiment with new design styles and techniques you wouldn’t usually risk in client work. Think of it as your creative lab partner who never judges your wildest ideas.\n\n\nSkill Up or Ship Out\nWith AI picking up routine tasks, creatives will need to double down on their unique human skills—like big-picture thinking, storytelling, and empathy. So, while AI becomes a tool for doing, we’ll need to become experts in knowing what to do and why. This shift isn’t just about working faster; it’s about working smarter, too.\n\n\nCollaborate Less, Create More\nFinally, while AI might reduce the need for constant team check-ins, it could make the collaboration we do have more meaningful. With the basics handled by our digital co-workers, teams could meet less for the mundane and more for the bold, creative decisions that actually matter.\n\n\nIn Short\nGenerative AI won’t make creatives redundant—it might just make us better at what we actually want to do. So if you’re worried about AI “taking your job,” don’t be. It’s just taking the bits you probably weren’t that thrilled to do anyway.\n\nHoffmann, Manuel and Boysel, Sam and Nagle, Frank and Peng, Sida and Xu, Kevin, Generative AI and the Nature of Work (October 27, 2024).

    "text": "When Pierre Azoulay analysed citation patterns among life scientists in 2014, he discovered something peculiar [1]. Papers by newly minted Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigators saw their citations jump by 12% overnight - not because the research improved, but because the letterhead changed. More tellingly, the boost nearly doubled for work published in lower-tier journals, where quality signals were murkiest. The finding vindicated a hypothesis sociologist Robert Merton had floated four decades ago [2]: in domains clouded by uncertainty, prestige doesn’t just predict success, it manufactures it.\nThis is the Matthew Effect in its purest form, named for the Gospel passage where “to those who have, more will be given.” Yet Merton’s 1968 essay in Science, and his richer 1988 follow-up in Isis [3], revealed something more profound than biblical coincidence. The Matthew Effect isn’t a bug in meritocracy’s code; it’s the operating system. And status branding (i.e. the deliberate cultivation of prestige as identity capital) is the mechanism that keeps the gears turning, converting minor early advantages into self-reinforcing dominance with the efficiency of compound interest."

    "section": "The Catalyst: When Affiliation Becomes Achievement",
    "text": "The Catalyst: When Affiliation Becomes Achievement\nConsider two lawyers, equally talented, graduating in the same cohort. One carries a Harvard credential; the other, a respectable regional university. By age 35, the Harvard alumnus will likely out-earn her peer by 30%, not because she litigates better cases, but because clients and partners encode her institutional affiliation as a proxy for competence [4]. A fundamental substitution has taken place: her worth is no longer assessed by examining her own capabilities, but rather by invoking the prestige of the institution that credentialed her. Her value is defined through identity and affiliation rather than intrinsic merit.\nThis is status branding as catalyst. Like a chemical reaction requiring an initial spark, cumulative advantage needs a starting asymmetry. Merton termed it an “institutional location” [3]. Top departments accelerate recognition, while elite schools open boardrooms. The mechanism is behavioural. Audiences, facing Knightian uncertainty about quality, resort to prestige hierarchies as cognitive shortcuts [5]. We cannot assess the lawyer’s true skill, so we default to the halo of her alma mater, much as 19th-century consumers judged craftsmanship by guild marks rather than tactile inspection.\nThe process compounds in a self-amplifying loop. [3]. Brands like Ferrari and Apple have mastered this. By limiting production and controlling supply, they ensure each product becomes a symbol of prestige and extraordinary craftsmanship, transforming ordinary items into coveted treasures through perceived scarcity [4]. Owning a Birkin bag or Harvard MBA confers status merely by association, initiating what Merton observed in science. Early fame speeds idea diffusion via citations, now scaled across consumer capitalism. The credential becomes the product; the product, a status symbol; the symbol, a self-fulfilling prophecy."

    "section": "The Shortcut: Uncertainty as Amplifier",
    "text": "The Shortcut: Uncertainty as Amplifier\nWhy does this work so reliably? Because quality, in most domains, is illegible. Merton called this the “Other Uncertainty Principle”: absent direct evidence of merit, we triangulate via prestige. Venture capitalists cannot predict which startup will succeed, so they favour Y Combinator alumni. Publishers cannot guarantee bestsellers, so they overpay authors with Penguin Random House pedigrees. Art collectors cannot objectively rank contemporary painters, so they defer to Sotheby’s provenance [4].\nAzoulay’s team found this amplification effect most pronounced when uncertainty about quality was highest. Publishing in lower-profile journals or exploring novel research areas provided more reason to doubt the science before the prize [1]. Status serves as social proof under fog, much as Cialdini described in Influence [6]. When unsure, we copy the crowd, or, more precisely, we copy whoever the crowd has already crowned. The citation premium for high-status scientists isn’t modest. It’s a structural phenomenon, embedded in how knowledge diffuses through networks where fame begets fame in a self-accelerating cycle[3].\nThe digital economy has supercharged this dynamic. Platforms reduce complex relationships to visual displays of quantity (i.e. followers, likes, citations). These displays serve as currency, often enshrining the Matthew Effect in their code base by algorithmically pushing content that is already gaining momentum [7]. Google Scholar’s ranking algorithm, critics note, weights citation counts heavily, ensuring highly cited papers appear in top positions and gain ever more citations, while new work struggles to surface. LinkedIn’s verification badges and Instagram’s blue ticks are prestige capture in microcosm. The algorithms reward the already-visible, turning personal branding into a digital Matthew trap [4]."

    "text": "The Flywheel: Self-Fulfilling Prophecy of Prestige\nOnce triggered, the Matthew Effect becomes circular. A product is deemed meritorious because it carries the logo of an anointed producer. The producer gains higher status for making such a “good product” [4]. This is not cynicism but economic rationality under incomplete information. Prestige pricing strategies rest on the belief that certain customer segments will pay more. To earn this premium, brands build narratives around legacy and unique value. They showcase exceptional quality through refined design and superior craftsmanship, and they build exclusivity through limited availability and scarcity.\nHermès exemplifies this alchemy [8], [9]. The Birkin bag’s mystique rests less on its exquisite leather than on its controlled scarcity and celebrity associations. From 1980 to 2015, Birkins appreciated at approximately 14% compound annual growth rate, outperforming fine jewelry and even the S&P 500 [9]. Hermès doesn’t just make handbags; it curates an experience of aspiration through invitation-only sales systems and waiting lists spanning over six years [9]. Buyers aren’t purchasing utility; they’re acquiring membership in a status hierarchy [4], much as Harvard’s endowment snowballs not from investment genius alone but from the reputational compounding of alumni networks. The credential or product becomes symbolic property, asserting dominance in a zero-sum game for recognition.\nMerton anticipated this in his analysis of intellectual property [3]. Scientists exchange knowledge freely for “reputational pellets” (i.e. citations) that aggregate into career capital. But this communism of ideas, meant to accelerate progress, breeds inequality. Priority disputes arise because credit is finite. Newton’s “standing on ye shoulders of Giants” was less an act of homage than a claim of intellectual property. In consumer markets, the same logic plays out. Brands don’t compete on quality alone but on the symbolic weight of their names, converting belief into outcome through feedback loops that solidify top dominance."

    "section": "The Inequality Machine",
    "text": "The Inequality Machine\nThe consequences are stark. Measures of academic success follow extremely right-skewed distributions. A minority of all academics produce the most research output and attract the most citations, with a 2018 study of science funding in the Netherlands finding that winners just above the funding threshold accumulated more than twice as much funding during the subsequent eight years as non-winners. Merton documented this in 1988 [3]: 28% of US federal research funds flowed to just 10 universities; 0.3% of articles garnered over 100 citations while 58% limped along with one.\nDiPrete and Eirich’s 2006 review in Annual Review of Sociology [10] framed this as a mechanism for inequality, not just an outcome. Status branding initiates the process. The funding, collaborators and publication slots concentrate among the anointed. The gaps widen longitudinally. Eminent scientists accrue larger increments of peer recognition for equivalent contributions, not because they work harder but because their reputations insulate them from scrutiny and amplify their visibility [3]. This is the Reverse Matthew Effect: high status protects against negatives. When retractions occur, Azoulay found [1], less eminent coauthors suffer greater reputational damage. Blame deflects upward to prestige, downward to obscurity.\nThe result is talent wastage. Merton worried about late bloomers. These “mutants” were found to drop out from elite milieus due to a preference for early bloomers [3]. Stanovich’s 1986 work on reading literacy found similar patterns [11]: early status gaps in primary school compound lifelong, disadvantaging children who bloom later cognitively. Social class exacerbates this. Privileged late bloomers persist via networks; working-class prodigies drop out when initial advantages fade. The Matthew Effect, left unchecked, doesn’t just reward merit unequally. It obscures merit entirely, mistaking pedigree for performance [4]."

    "text": "The AI Acceleration\nAs artificial intelligence (AI) floods information markets, status heuristics grow more potent, not less. Faced with abundance, humans double down on reputation scarcity. We cannot parse a million research papers, so we defer to Nature’s anointing. We cannot vet a thousand fintech startups, so we follow Sequoia’s portfolio. AI was supposed to democratise access. Instead, it has amplified the halo of anointed creators. OpenAI’s early backers enjoy disproportionate valuations not from superior products but from association with the buzziest brand in tech. The algorithm, supposedly neutral, encodes yesterday’s prestige into tomorrow’s opportunities [4].\nThis phenomenon has birthed masstige marketing [12], [13]. Masstige targets the middle class by combining luxury brand values with mass-market access, promising consumers superior experience, engagement, and status through expensive or premium products marketed to many. Apple captured 46% of global smartphone revenue in 2024 while holding just 19% of market share [14] — prestige pricing at planetary scale. Nike’s Air Jordans function as collectibles, their value inflating through timed releases and artificial scarcity. These aren’t products; they’re status signalling devices, repackaging exclusivity for mass consumption [13].\nThe danger is expropriation without credit - Merton’s nightmare scenario [3]. When ideas circulate freely but attribution collapses under algorithmic curation, late-stage creators reap rewards while originators languish in obscurity. LinkedIn’s blue-tick economy exemplifies this: verified influencers amplify each other’s content, creating closed loops of visibility while unverified voices shout into the void. The prestige economy becomes a zero-sum tournament where network effects entrench incumbents, and new entrants need exponentially more talent to break through [4]."

    "text": "The Randomness Solution: Betting on Unknowns\nCan we escape this trap? The conventional answer of diversity initiatives, blind review, and credential-obscuring misses the deeper problem. These interventions still optimise for past performance, retrofitting yesterday’s patterns onto tomorrow’s talent. They’re actuarial thinking dressed in progressive language, measuring historical correlations and rebalancing portfolios of known quantities [4].\nClayton Christensen grasped the core dilemma [15]. When managers wait until data is clear, the game is over. Actuarial models excel at pricing existing risks (e.g. mortality tables, credit defaults, insurance claims) but catastrophically fail at predicting disruption. They look backward from the iceberg’s impact, calculating damage with precision, then steer straight into it. The future belongs not to those who optimise for the known past, but to those who inject sufficient randomness into selection processes. Merton called them the “countervailing forces” against cumulative advantage [3].\nThis requires magnanimity toward failure, a tolerance for backing unknowns. Funding lotteries, as practiced by New Zealand’s Health Research Council and increasingly advocated by scientists can randomise early advantages. They’re not meritocratic in the credentialist sense; they’re anti-Matthean. By selecting proposals that clear a quality threshold assisted by a lottery process, rather than expert ranking, they eliminate the institutional halo. Failure becomes permissible, even necessary, because the system no longer pretends omniscience about potential [4].\nContrast this with planned diversity hires, which often backfire by encoding new status markers. Hiring for “diverse backgrounds” while demanding Ivy League credentials simply reshuffles prestige hierarchies without disrupting them. True disruption means choosing candidates with no legible pedigree, no traceable prestige DNA. These may include immigrants from unranked institutions, late bloomers without publications, autodidacts without portfolios. It means betting on potential futures rather than auditing actuarial pasts [15].\nThe iceberg metaphor applies here too. Organisations fixated on visible credentials (i.e., the proverbial tip above water) miss the submerged mass of latent talent. Merton’s late bloomers [2] attrite precisely because systems optimise for early-stage visibility. But early achievement is often privilege: access to resources, networks, and institutional location that accelerate recognition. The child who publishes at 22 had advantages the night-shift worker studying at 32 did not. Randomness corrects for this by refusing to privilege legibility itself[4]."

    "text": "The Prestige Paradox\nStatus branding is both currency and cage. For the rich, it’s protective, insulating against failure. For the rest, it’s punitive, deflecting blame downward. Merton likened science’s free exchange of knowledge to an uncommon good. It grows through use rather than depleting like pastures [3]. But this good, secured by symbolic property, breeds inequality as surely as enclosures did. The Matthew Effect isn’t a moral failing; it’s an emergent property of how humans navigate uncertainty under resource constraints [4].\nWe cannot abolish prestige. Reputational hierarchies are cognitive necessities in a world too complex to audit fully. But we can refuse to let them calcify into destiny. The answer isn’t diversifying the anointed. It’s choosing the unknown. Rotate collaborations so junior researchers work with senior stars to diffuse prestige via proximity rather than inheritance. Strip author names from grant proposals during review. Limit citation counts visible to editors to force engagement with ideas rather than CVs. Weight variance over consistency. Reward wild swings over steady incrementalism, because disruption requires tolerating failure [15].\nThe true Matthew miracle, then, isn’t spotting talent before the halo descends. It’s backing candidates before legibility emerges. As Christensen observed [15], theory beats data for predicting the future. Gravity predicts you’ll fall from a cliff without requiring historical evidence. The theory here is simple: prestige compounds existing advantages, so inject randomness to disrupt compounding. Choose unknowns as part of a cohort. Permit failure. Bet on potential, not pedigree.\nIn a prestige economy rigged to reward yesterday’s winners, the most subversive act isn’t refining selection. It’s admitting we cannot predict genius and designing for that humility. The ship hits the iceberg because actuaries optimise for the past. The future belongs to leaders willing to steer into fog, knowing some will fail but others will discover new worlds. Magnanimity toward failure isn’t soft; it’s the only escape from cumulative advantage’s iron law [4]."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Klarna, the Swedish payments giant, has taken a revolutionary approach to its marketing strategy by handing over complete control of 30 campaigns across 45 countries to generative AI. This bold experiment not only demonstrated the creative potential of AI but also showcased its ability to deliver significant business impact.\nTraditionally, large-scale campaigns require vast resources for localised imagery, nuanced translations, and culturally resonant content. Klarna’s AI-driven campaigns streamlined this process dramatically. Tools like MidJourney and Firefly were employed to create visuals, replacing traditional production pipelines and eliminating the need for stock imagery. These innovations reduced the production cycle from six weeks to just seven days while ensuring high-quality, brand-aligned content.\n\n“Historically, we had to pay an agency or an artist to bring these ideas to life. We’ve saved millions on that ideation process alone,” Klarna’s CMO, David Sandstrom, said.\n\nThe results speak volumes. Marketing costs were slashed by 11% in Q1 2024, amounting to approximately $10 million in savings. This includes a $6 million reduction in image production costs and $4 million saved on external suppliers for tasks like translations and CRM management. Beyond cost savings, the AI campaigns delivered outstanding engagement metrics, with some email click-through rates surging by up to 400%.\nThis strategy allowed the company to scale personalised marketing for events such as Mother’s Day and Black Friday without the logistical bottlenecks of traditional workflows. AI didn’t just match human-created campaigns in quality—it often surpassed them in both creativity and performance.\nThis experiment underscores a pivotal moment in designing marketing strategies: generative AI isn’t just a brutally efficient cost-cutting tool but a driver of innovation and growth, redefining how brands connect with their audiences. The ability to maintain brand integrity while scaling creative output could nudge other brands to rethink their marketing strategies, proving that AI has moved from being an experiment to a competitive necessity. The challenge now is ensuring these innovations remain rooted in the human-centred principles that underpin great design.\nIs your brand ready to embrace AI as a co-creator?\n\nEkman, H., & Strand, E.

    "text": "“You have to swim with the sharks in the sea…” — Johnny Clegg, “Cruel, Crazy, Beautiful World,” 1989\nIs generative AI the end of creativity? Not at all. Designers are now swimming alongside AI—not being replaced but gaining a powerful ally, for now. According to MIT’s recent study, Artificial Intelligence, Scientific Discovery, and Product Innovation by Aidan Toner-Rodgers, AI is a transformative partner reshaping R&D. Here’s a breakdown of key insights and their implications for designers:\n\nMore Innovation: Scientists using AI discovered 44% more novel materials, leading to a 39% rise in patent filings and a 17% boost in prototypes. For designers, this could mean faster ideation and exploration of creative possibilities.\nMore Novel Ideas: AI-driven discoveries introduced unique innovations instead of mere upgrades. This suggests that AI has the potential to push designers beyond simple refinements, opening entirely new avenues in form, function, and concept.\nUnequal Benefits: Only the most productive scientists saw significant gains, while others benefited less. This insight implies that designers who excel at developing and filtering ideas are best positioned to leverage AI effectively.\nEvaluation is Key: While AI generates more ideas, scientists spent extra time determining which were valuable. Designers may likewise need to sharpen their “curation” skills to select the most promising AI-generated designs.\nExpertise Matters: Scientists with strong judgement skills thrived, focusing on promising ideas and ignoring noise. For designers, AI doesn’t replace expertise—it makes it even more crucial. Those who can discern quality in AI’s flood of options will excel.\nProductivity vs. Satisfaction: Despite increased productivity, many scientists reported feeling less satisfied, sensing that their creativity was underutilised. This emphasises that designers should develop AI tools that truly complement their creative strengths, rather than let AI define their process.\n\nThe Bottom Line: The best results come to those who know how to handle AI-generated ideas. Expertise and curation are essential as AI churns out concepts at unprecedented speed. The question isn’t “Will AI replace us?” but rather, “Will we adapt fast enough to co-create effectively?”\nGenerative AI can amplify our work—but those who excel will be the ones who turn AI’s raw output into refined creativity.\n\nCheck out the full MIT study on AI and Innovation from Aidan Toner-Rodgers here:\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17866"

    "text": "Throughout 2024, while South African soldiers died fighting M23 rebels in the DRC, the insurgent group’s political leadership maintained operations from a Johannesburg office building. They were raising funds, managing propaganda, and running what amounted to a shadow government. This surreal arrangement exemplified South Africa’s transformation from regional hegemon to what security analysts began calling a “continental hinterland”: the insurgent’s back office, where the messy business of modern warfare was coordinated at a comfortable distance from actual combat. Though M23’s operations have since shifted to territories under their control in eastern DRC, the pattern they established—and which other groups continue to exploit—reveals how South Africa’s institutional decay has made it essential infrastructure for transnational insurgency. All of the coordination, none of the violence. Until the violence comes home."

    "text": "The Dual Reality\nFew episodes better illustrated South Africa’s compromised security posture than what transpired throughout 2024. South African National Defence Force (SANDF) soldiers died in combat against the M23 rebel group in the Democratic Republic of Congo, ultimately forcing a humiliating withdrawal in February 2025 (according to an International Crisis Group assessment) [1], [2]. For much of that period, the political leadership of that very same insurgent force operated from an unremarkable Johannesburg office building, raising funds, managing propaganda, and coordinating what could only be described as a parallel state apparatus [3].\nYet M23’s playbook of diaspora mobilization, procurement networks and female-coordinated logistics wasn’t unique. It was a template other groups had already perfected. While bombs detonate in Mogadishu and the Sahel descends further into chaos, the financial plumbing, political coordination, and logistical architecture sustaining these conflicts continues to run through Cape Town, Durban, and Johannesburg. South Africa’s transformation from regional power to insurgent logistics hub represents a deliberate confluence of institutional decay, diplomatic ambiguity, and strategic incoherence. The violence happens elsewhere; Johannesburg still provides the back office.\nThanks for reading The Spotted Ape! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.\nThe term “continental hinterland” describes precisely this arrangement—a back office where the messy business of insurgency is conducted at a comfortable distance from actual fighting [3]. By early 2025, M23 had consolidated control over Goma, Bukavu, and other territories in North and South Kivu provinces, shifting their operational base to areas under their direct military control. Their South African presence served its purpose: establishing financial networks, procurement channels, and diaspora coordination mechanisms that could later be managed remotely. The infrastructure outlasted the physical presence."

    "section": "Why Did M23 Operate Openly in Johannesburg?",
    "text": "Why Did M23 Operate Openly in Johannesburg?\nThroughout 2024, the Congo River Alliance (AFC), M23’s political wing, maintained an operational hub in South Africa’s commercial capital [1], [2]. Whether the AFC was formally registered as a South African entity remains unclear from public records, but its operations were hardly clandestine—diaspora mobilization, narrative management, and according to intelligence assessments, the laundering of proceeds from mining operations in the mineral-rich Kivu provinces [3].\nThe cognitive dissonance bears repeating: Pretoria dispatched battalions to MONUSCO peacekeeping operations to contain an insurgency whose political leadership enjoyed freedom of operation within South Africa’s borders. Between 2023 and 2024, South African forces suffered casualties in direct combat with M23 fighters [2]. The political apparatus directing those fighters, coordinating their messaging, managing their finances, and procuring advanced military technology operated in Johannesburg, unmolested by law enforcement [3], [4].\nStrategic incoherence seemed the obvious diagnosis. The more accurate interpretation: deliberate diplomatic ambiguity providing insurgent groups with a permissive operating environment. South Africa’s foreign policy establishment prided itself on “South-South solidarity,” on refusing to simply adopt Western designations of terrorist organizations, on commitment to “African solutions to African problems.” These may be noble principles. When they translated into allowing an insurgent group’s political wing to openly fundraise and procure military equipment while your own soldiers died fighting that group’s military wing, principle had curdled into something else entirely.\nWomen played a critical coordinating role in M23’s South African operations during 2024, particularly in managing community-level fundraising networks within Congolese diaspora populations. Female relatives of combatants maintained family connections that facilitated both recruitment and resource extraction, operating through positions of trust that made them less visible to intelligence services focused primarily on identifying male financiers and procurement specialists (based on gendered intelligence patterns documented by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime) [5]."

    "text": "The Financial Architecture of Modern Insurgency\nSouth Africa possesses, simultaneously, one of Africa’s most advanced banking sectors and one of its largest informal economies. For insurgent financiers, this is the entire point.\n\n\n\nSouth Africa’s bifurcated financial architecture allows the coexistence of SWIFT-integrated banking and informal hawala systems creating an ideal environment for money laundering.\n\n\nThe Hoomer and Miller networks in Durban and Cape Town, partially disrupted by U.S. Treasury designations in 2022, operated through a clever integration of legitimate businesses and informal value transfer systems. Treasury documented transfers exceeding $69,000 to the Allied Democratic Forces in the DRC and ISIS operations across the continent (according to U.S. Treasury sanctions documentation) [6], [7]. Gold trading firms, retail operations, and import-export businesses all provided cover for what Treasury described as “many-to-one” transaction patterns, where fragmented hawala remittances coalesced into larger transfers.\nThe amounts might seem modest by Wall Street standards. In conflict zones, that sum buys substantial ammunition, significant bribes, and sufficient logistical capacity to sustain operations for months [7], [8]. The sophistication lies in methodology, exploiting the gap between South Africa’s formal banking oversight and its sprawling, largely unregulated informal economy.\nAl-Shabaab’s fundraising apparatus demonstrates a different approach. The group relies on what it terms zakat—the extraction of obligatory Islamic charitable contributions from the Somali diaspora through religious obligation and familial coercion. There is nothing subtle about this: families in South Africa receive visits, phone calls, reminders that relatives back home might face consequences should contributions dry up. The funds flow through community networks, automotive businesses, grocery stores—sectors historically resistant to state oversight and well-suited to cash-based transactions [5], [9].\nWomen manage the operational backbone of these financial networks within South African diaspora communities. In Johannesburg and Cape Town, Somali women operate the small retail businesses (spaza shops, clothing stores, remittance outlets) that serve as conduits for laundering extortion proceeds. These women maintain the family connections enabling coercive fundraising, where implicit threats to relatives in Somalia ensure compliance. Traditional intelligence paradigms focus on male combatants and financiers, creating blind spots that al-Shabaab exploits systematically. The women coordinating these community-embedded networks occupy positions of trust that make them ideally placed to manage the micro-logistics of insurgent financing while remaining largely invisible to law enforcement (according to regional security assessments) [10], [11].\nWhat makes South Africa particularly attractive is the integration of informal channels with sophisticated formal banking infrastructure. Money enters through hawala systems, launders through legitimate businesses, exits through conventional banking, all while exploiting regulatory gaps and enforcement weakness [4]. A three-card monte performed with regulatory oversight consistently watching the wrong hand."

    "section": "The Hollowing of the State",
    "text": "The Hollowing of the State\nNone of this would be possible without what South Africans euphemistically call “state capture”—the systematic corruption and institutional erosion that characterized the Zuma administration and whose aftereffects continue to reverberate. When insurgent financiers exploit South African infrastructure, they aren’t defeating state institutions so much as operating in the vacuum left by their collapse.\nThe South African National Prosecuting Authority and the South African Police Service emerged from the state capture era as hollow institutions—organizationally intact yet operationally enfeebled. Critical investigative units were dismantled, experienced prosecutors driven out, intelligence capabilities allowed to atrophy. What remained was a culture of non-enforcement, where even when suspicious transactions were flagged, the capacity or will to pursue them was absent.\nThis institutional decay creates what might be termed “structural impunity.” Farhad Hoomer, the Durban-based businessman designated by U.S. Treasury for ISIS financing, operated for years before facing consequences (according to Treasury sanctions documentation) [7]. His network wasn’t particularly well-hidden; it simply existed in an enforcement vacuum.\nThe problem extends beyond individual prosecutions. The infrastructure of enforcement—interagency coordination, financial intelligence analysis, cross-border cooperation—was allowed to deteriorate during state capture and has not been rebuilt. The Financial Intelligence Centre can flag suspicious transactions; when those flags lead nowhere, when investigations stall, when prosecutions fail to materialize, technical compliance becomes theatrical. Impressive on paper, meaningless in practice."

    "section": "The Grey List Paradox",
    "text": "The Grey List Paradox\nSouth Africa’s removal from the Financial Action Task Force grey list in October 2025 was hailed by government as vindication of counter-financing reforms. From a technical standpoint, the reforms were substantial: enhanced customer due diligence, improved beneficial ownership transparency, strengthened reporting requirements. The kind of measures that look impressive in FATF evaluation reports [12].\nTechnical compliance can coexist with operational ineffectiveness. FATF assessments evaluate whether regulatory architecture exists, not whether it actually disrupts illicit finance. South Africa built the architecture. Whether it functions as intended remains a different question entirely.\nThe grey list removal may actually worsen the problem. It reduces international scrutiny precisely when that scrutiny might be most needed. It signals that the money laundering problem has been addressed when, in reality, only the regulatory framework has been updated. The networks that sustained ISIS financing before October 2025 didn’t dissolve with South Africa’s delisting; they continued operating beneath a more polished regulatory facade.\nThe emphasis on formal banking sector compliance misses the point when much problematic activity occurs in the informal economy. Enhanced bank supervision becomes irrelevant if money never touches a bank. Hawala networks, cash-based businesses, community-embedded extortion—none of this falls neatly within FATF’s evaluation criteria, which are designed for formal financial systems.\nEven more troubling are sectors that lubricate insurgent logistics while evading quantitative capture entirely. Illegal mining operations (the so-called zama-zamas) and cigarette smuggling networks provide both revenue streams and operational cover for insurgent financing [12], [13]. These informal economies exist in a regulatory twilight zone, too dispersed to monitor effectively, too embedded in local communities to disrupt without significant political cost."

    "section": "The Emerging Threat of Domestic Blowback",
    "text": "The Emerging Threat of Domestic Blowback\nSouth Africa’s role remains primarily logistical—coordination without combat, infrastructure without carnage. This arrangement contains the seeds of its own transformation. Hinterlands have a nasty habit of becoming frontlines.\nThe dynamics are straightforward: When insurgent groups establish deep logistical roots in a territory, they develop local networks, recruit local operatives, create dependencies. Over time, these groups acquire the capability and potentially the motivation to conduct operations within their host territory. ISIS affiliates that currently use South Africa for fundraising and coordination could, if circumstances warrant, pivot to using it as an operational theater.\nThe deepening organizational structure—the recruitment of families, the embedding in community networks, the development of female-managed logistical architectures—indicates these groups aren’t merely passing through. They’re putting down roots. The more embedded they become, the more vulnerable South Africa becomes to domestic blowback that transforms rear bases into frontline targets.\nHistorical precedents exist, all pointing toward escalation. London served as a rear base for various Middle Eastern militant groups throughout the 1990s until it didn’t. The permissive environment that made it attractive as a logistical hub eventually made it attractive as a target. The 7/7 bombings were conducted by British citizens radicalized within networks initially established for external operations.\nSouth Africa need not replicate London’s experience, but the risk factors are alarmingly similar: deep diaspora networks, institutional weakness, enforcement gaps, and a political establishment that mistakes non-alignment for immunity. The longer these networks operate, the more embedded they become, and the more difficult they are to disrupt without triggering precisely the kind of domestic blowback that officials currently believe they’re avoiding."

    "section": "What Happens Next?",
    "text": "What Happens Next?\nSouth Africa finds itself in a paradoxical position: removed from the FATF grey list while functioning as a critical node in continental insurgent infrastructure; having hosted M23’s political operations while sending soldiers to die fighting them; possessing sophisticated anti-money laundering regulations while insurgent financing networks operate with relative impunity.\nThe fundamental problem is political will masquerading as technical capacity. South Africa’s government has demonstrated it can build regulatory architecture when international pressure demands it. What it has not demonstrated is willingness to actually use that architecture to disrupt the networks that matter. Designating a few financiers to satisfy American demands is one thing; systematically dismantling hawala networks, prosecuting community leaders engaged in extortion, and proscribing insurgent political fronts is quite another.\nSuch systematic disruption would require confronting an uncomfortable reality: South-South solidarity and non-alignment have practical limits. There is no particular virtue in providing sanctuary to groups engaged in mass violence, regardless of whether Western governments have designated them as terrorists. It would require rebuilding prosecutorial and intelligence capacity gutted during state capture. It would require developing intelligence frameworks that can actually identify and disrupt the female-managed logistics networks that current approaches systematically overlook—frameworks that recognize women’s roles in al-Shabaab’s zakat collection, M23’s diaspora coordination, and ISIS affiliate financial management as central to operational success rather than peripheral support functions.\nAbove all, it would require political courage."

    "section": "Concrete policy measures that should be implemented immediately:",
    "text": "Concrete policy measures that should be implemented immediately:\nSouth Africa’s Financial Intelligence Centre requires two immediate interventions: First, forensic analysis of M23’s historical financial flows to identify ongoing nodes—the businesses, intermediaries, and community structures that don’t dissolve when clients relocate but simply find new ones. Second, emergency funding for a dedicated informal economy monitoring unit focused on hawala networks and cash-intensive sectors like spaza shops, automotive businesses, and gold trading that current formal banking compliance frameworks cannot touch. Al-Shabaab, ISIS affiliates, and other groups continue to exploit precisely these gaps.\nLaw enforcement must develop gender-sensitive intelligence training programs that recognize female-managed logistical networks as primary targets rather than peripheral concerns. The women coordinating community fundraising, managing small retail businesses, and maintaining diaspora connections aren’t supporting roles in insurgent infrastructure—they are the infrastructure. M23’s 2024 operations demonstrated this; al-Shabaab’s ongoing networks prove it daily.\nUntil such measures materialize, South Africa will continue its role as continental hinterland. M23 may have relocated to territories under their control, but the financial flows that sustained their 2024 operations continue through other channels and other groups. Al-Shabaab’s extortion networks expand, ISIS affiliate financing persists, and the female-managed logistical architectures deepen. The infrastructure M23 helped establish remains available, adaptable, and increasingly sophisticated.\nThe question isn’t whether this arrangement is sustainable—it manifestly isn’t—but when and how it collapses. A gradual awakening to the threat, accompanied by genuine institutional revitalization, remains possible. So does an alternative: waiting for a domestic atrocity to concentrate minds.\nIf there’s one lesson from the last two decades of counter-terrorism, it’s this: by the time the violence reaches home, it’s already far too late to prevent it. The insurgent’s back office doesn’t remain a back office forever. Eventually, inevitably, it becomes the front.\nSouth Africa still has time to avert that future. Time, like institutional capacity and political will, is not an infinite resource. The meter is running."

    "section": "",
    "text": "&gt; “It’s the end of explanations, a great increase in reality is here.” –K Allado-McDowell and GPT-3, Air Age Blueprint\nAI’s integration into the field of design appears to be highlighting a profound transition from creating artefacts to working with systems that think, adapt, and influence. In K Allado-McDowell’s compelling youtube talk, Designing Neural Media, a framework emerges that challenges us to rethink our role as designers in this new era. Drawing on the legacy of visionaries like McLuhan, K’s work maps out a 30-year evolution of media that progresses from broadcast and immersive forms, through network media, and now into the realm of neural media.\nAllado-McDowell proposes a cogent continuum of four media waves. First is Broadcast Media, traditional media such as radio and television employing one-to-many communication, which developed from the 1920s to the 1950s. Second is Immersive Media, which provide engaging experiences like cinema and virtual reality, spanning from the 1950s to the 1980s. Third is Network Media, encompassing the internet and social media and enabling user interaction, emerging from the 1980s to the 2010s. Fourth is Neural Media, AI-based media (i.e., generative AI and brain-computer interfaces) that are emerging from the 2010s-2020s and beyond.\nAllado-McDowell argues that this latest wave is built on AI’s neural networks and hints at future integrations with brain-computer interfaces, transforming our tools from passive artefacts into dynamic, generative systems that not only respond but also learn and adapt. For modern design strategists, this shift demands we move beyond pursuing aesthetic excellence and conventional problem-solving; instead, we are now tasked with architecting intelligence itself. The challenge lies in creating systems that think, adapt, and ultimately influence human cognition, thereby fundamentally reshaping our approach to design.\nCentral to Allado-McDowell’s argument is the notion that we are at an early, malleable stage in the development of neural media. We are at a pivotal moment when design choices can shape cultural identity, ethical norms, and even political structures. Designing neural media, therefore, involves developing a critical literacy to understand AI’s capabilities, limitations, and underlying biases. It calls for experimentation (i.e., engaging in co-creation projects with AI) which can reveal entirely new modes of artistic expression and subjectivity. Moreover, by actively engaging with these emerging technologies, designers and creators can promote values like inclusivity, creativity, and democratic subject formation, whilst mitigating risks such as bias, manipulation, and loss of privacy. Allado-McDowell compares this process to guiding the growth of a tree, where early interventions in the structure of neural media can profoundly affect how we come to understand ourselves and our relationship with technology.\nEmbracing neural media compels us to integrate ethical considerations, cultural context, and systems thinking into our work. It is about designing for an interconnected future in which our creations actively shape and redefine the human experience. Allado-McDowell’s insights suggest that deep engagement with these emerging technologies is essential to building a future where design and intelligent systems co-evolve for the betterment of society.

Traditionally, UI was the bulk of the user experience, like an inverted pyramid. But AI-first systems are flipping this upside down.

    "text": "The Skills Gap Widens\nThe academic research analysing 43 sources across industry and academia (Maré, 2025) found that 95% of a UX designer’s contribution should now focus on: use case validation, AI model research, data flow workshops, understanding AI decision matrices, and customer problem-solving.\nUI design? “Probably 5% is the actual UI design” (Nudelman, 2025)."

    "section": "The Path Forward",
    "text": "The Path Forward\nThe path forward isn’t about Figma being replaced by AI. It is rather about the UI itself becoming less central to user experience. Companies like IBM are already moving toward design systems as code (IBM, 2025), while conversational interfaces minimise the need for traditional visual design.\nThe designers thriving in this shift are those who’ve evolved from “pixel pushers” to experience designers in the true sense of the word, that focus on how AI models behave, what data flows through systems, and how to validate real user problems."

    "text": "The Bottom Line\nAs Nudelman (2025) puts it: “If you, as a UX designer, are seen as somebody who is continuously slowing down the release process in favor of adding decoration, instead of speeding up and streamlining delivery of value, you are going to be seen as a bottleneck and your position will be eliminated.”\nThe question isn’t whether Figma will adapt (they’re certainly trying with recent AI features). It’s whether the entire premise of visual-first design tools remains relevant when the interface itself is disappearing.\nPertinent to this dilemma is the recent launch of Jonathan Ive’s io: a collaboration between LoveFrom and OpenAI. Key to the collaboration is the recognition that the interface is dissolving and that we need a new set of tools. Strapping jet engines to old chariots is bound to fail.\nSam Altman and Jony Ive present their collaboration (OpenAI, 2025).\n\nAre you seeing this shift in your own work? How are you adapting your design practice for AI-first systems?"

    "text": "It is Germany, 1922. László Moholy-Nagy lifts the receiver of a telephone. On the other end, a porcelain-enamel factory in Weimar (Figure 1). Calmly, almost bureaucratically, he dictates: “Three panels. A yellow square. A black line. A red square in the corner” [1], [2].\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Reconstruction of László Moholy-Nagy dictating instructions by telephone to a Weimar enamel factory worker, 1922 [3].\n\n\nA worker writes it down, following procedure with a colour chart and a sheet of graph paper. Nothing more. No trembling hand of the artist, no fevered gesture of inspiration. Just instructions, processed and executed. The result: three enamel panels, with EM 1 Telephonbild (Telephone Picture) (Figure 2) as the first, as described [4]. A creation Moholy-Nagy never physically touched, yet one that bears his name.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. László Moholy-Nagy, EM 1 Telephonbild (Telephone Picture), 1923. Enamel on steel, 69.9 ×44.5 cm. The Museum of Modern Art, New York [4].\n\n\nThese panels are not traditional painterly works. They are conceptual designs brought to life by factory hands, embodying “art as information.” Some have described this as a forerunner to digitisation, where ideas transcend the artist’s direct touch, realised instead through systematic execution [5], [6]. In a sense Moholy-Nagy anticipated our present AI delirium [6], [7]. A world where an artist no longer paints, but prompts. No longer carves, but curates. Where the telephone becomes a collaborator. A century later, we are back on that line. Only now the voice that listens, listens back. It learns. It suggests. The anxiety is familiar. In Weimar, the fear was that machines would strip human beings of their essence, reducing life to mechanical noise [8], [9]. Today, it is algorithms that threaten to erode what we think of as human. They are silent, ambient, impossible to grasp. Yet Moholy-Nagy’s wager was not despair but optimism [10], [11]. He believed that technology could expand the field of human experience rather than compress it. That art might be a shared atmosphere of instructions and responses, drifting free of the solitary studio. László Moholy-Nagy placed great emphasis on our perceptual capacity, where seeing, feeling, and thinking converge as we move [11], [12]. Preparing the senses does not guarantee novelty, but it does invite unpredictable creative avenues with form, light, and motion. Seen this way, the Telephone Picture was never simply enamel on steel [2]. It was a parable about how to live with systems we cannot fully control, but with which we must learn to converse. To dial, and be dialled in return. The conversation itself becomes the artwork. To design in such a space is to design in a white water world, where stability is fleeting and flow is the constant, as John Seely Brown suggests [13]. This was Moholy-Nagy’s true provocation. A question that remains unresolved in every AI prompt we type: If I conceive it, must I make it? While others recoiled from the encroaching machine, Moholy-Nagy leaned forward, convinced that technology was not an end of art, but a transformation of it [1], [10], [14]. The brushstroke replaced by the spark of instruction. A hundred years on, we are still whispering into the receiver: “blue circle here, yellow field there.” And the machine still replies.\n\nReferences\n\nK. Passuth, Moholy-Nagy.

    "title": "AI’s Avalanche Is Coming – Are You Ready?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The recent viral clip, shared by Harry Shimmin, mirrors the seismic upheaval generative AI is bringing to the design space. What began as a distant hum—tools quietly assisting with iterations—has surged into a transformative force, reshaping how ideas are conceived, refined, and executed.\nWhen I first tried chatGPT with MidJourney and DALL-E 3, I realised an avalanche was coming. It took a concept I’d been stuck on for weeks and turned it into something real. AI as a creative tool is pushing us past our limits. ChatGPTo1 is here. Cursor, Replit, and 3D AI are knocking on the door. The AI agents aren’t just beckoning. They’re pulling up chairs at the table. Will AI eat the world? Maybe not all at once, but it sure looks hungry.\n\nPrototyping the Future: AI as a Catalyst for Innovation\nIn the creative design field, the iterative process has long been constrained by time and resources. AI obliterates those limits. Tools like Midjourney, Magnific AI, Runway and MiniMax‘s HailuoAI now allow designers to test dozens of visual ideas in hours rather than weeks. The ability to render photorealistic product concepts or conceptual ad campaigns in real time compresses timelines and broadens possibilities.\nYet, it’s more than just speed. Accenture reports companies that successfully integrate AI into innovation processes achieve up to 15% greater revenue performance than their peers, with that margin set to more than double by 2026. In creative design, this could mean agencies that embrace AI not only deliver faster but develop work that connects more deeply with audiences.\nConsider the rise of hyper-personalised content. AI-powered algorithms can tailor designs to individual preferences at scale, creating bespoke customer experiences. For example, a fashion brand might use generative AI to design personalised marketing campaigns as pioneered by Klarna, adapting not only the message but the aesthetic to align with a recipient’s tastes and buying history.\n\n\n\nCreativity Augmented, Not Replaced\nA perennial fear in the design world is that AI might supplant human ingenuity. But as the Creative Trends Report 2025 of Adobe suggests, the reality is far more collaborative. AI is emerging as a co-creator, amplifying human potential rather than replacing it.\nFor designers, an example of the new workflows looks like this: start with a loose concept, use AI to generate a spectrum of iterations, then apply human intuition to refine and align the results with a specific vision or brand ethos. It’s the difference between sketching a dozen ideas yourself and having a tool suggest hundreds, freeing the designer to focus on selection and aesthetic finishing.\nThis dynamic partnership goes beyond efficiency. It encourages designers to explore ideas previously deemed too abstract or unfeasible. By removing the technical and financial constraints of traditional prototyping, AI enables creative risks that might have been discarded at the brainstorming stage.\n\n\n\nThe Skills Avalanche: Preparing for the Shift\nWith these opportunities comes a demand for new expertise. Creative professionals who once focused solely on aesthetics or messaging must now learn to interface with technology. Bain & Company’s research report highlights the growing importance of hybrid roles that include:\n\nPrompt Engineers: Experts in crafting precise AI instructions to achieve desired design outputs.\nData Storytellers: Professionals who translate AI-driven insights into compelling narratives for campaigns.\n\nThe shift requires not just new skills but a new mindset—one that sees AI as a creative partner rather than a competitor. Forward-looking agencies and firms are already investing in training programs to bridge this gap, ensuring their teams remain agile in an AI-driven world.\n\n\n\nEthics in Design: Creativity Meets Responsibility\nThe creative design space sits at the crossroads of opportunity and risk. As AI generates breathtakingly realistic visuals and compelling narratives, the potential for misuse grows. From deepfake content to algorithmic bias, the risks to trust and integrity in design are significant.\nKantar Media‘s 2025 Media Trends and Predictions highlights a key concern: users are demanding transparency about how AI tools shape what they see. For designers, this means developing clear frameworks around content ownership, disclosure of AI’s role in creation, and safeguarding against manipulation.\nAgencies must internalize the legal and ethical implications of AI-driven creativity. This isn’t about ticking boxes or setting up bureaucratic committees—it’s about embedding a culture of responsibility into every stage of the creative process. Designers and strategists need to ask hard questions: Who owns the content? How do we ensure fairness? What happens if AI makes a decision we can’t explain?\nThe answers won’t come from more paperwork but from a mindset shift—treating ethical considerations as integral to design, not an afterthought. Brands thrive on trust, and in an AI-powered world, trust isn’t won by accident.\n\n\n\nReimagining Strategy: The Designer’s Role in an AI-Driven World\nThe influx of AI tools isn’t just a technological revolution; it’s a cultural one. The role of a designer is shifting from executor to orchestrator—someone who leverages AI to imagine new possibilities, then crafts the connective tissue that makes those ideas resonate.\nReal-time market insights powered by generative AI are changing the way creative teams approach campaigns. No longer static, strategies evolve dynamically based on continuous feedback from AI models. This adaptability is a game-changer, enabling brands to stay ahead in rapidly shifting markets.\nBut success demands more than technological fluency. Designers must remain the guardians of empathy and authenticity, ensuring AI outputs reflect the human values that make great design timeless.\nJust as Harry Shimmin in Kyrgyzstan escaped the avalanche by correctly estimating its momentum. For designers, it’s like finding out your competition isn’t just faster—it’s tireless, omnipresent, and suspiciously good at brainstorming at 3 a.m. You can’t out-sketch it, out-code it, or outlast it. The avalanche is here. Ride it, or hope your bunker holds.\nAfter all, if software ate the world, AI seems ready for dessert.\nHow did you use AI in creative workflows this year?

    "text": "When President Trump declared last week that acquiring Greenland represents “a national security priority” and his press secretary confirmed that “utilising the U.S. Military is always an option” [1], the pronouncement generated predictable outrage. Danish officials pushed back forcefully [2], whilst NATO allies issued stern statements about sovereignty [3]. At the same time in Svalbard, where China’s Yellow River Research Station has stood since 2004, Norway ordered the removal of symbolic stone lions from the facility’s entrance—a telling indication of how even ostensibly scientific Arctic presences have become sites of geopolitical contestation [4].\n\n\n\nStrategic drivers of Arctic importance:(1) High-value territories such as Greenland and Svalbard serve as critical nodes, (2) subsurface-to-space (S2S) nexus makes the Arctic a frontier for hybrid, sub-threshold operations, (3) legal gaps between space and maritime law are exploited for strategic advantage, and (4) arctic multi-domain control links communications, missile defence, and intelligence collection across theaters.\n\n\nGreenland and Svalbard are critical military nodes; the S2S nexus enables hybrid operations, legal gaps are exploited strategically, and multi-domain control links communications, missile defense, and intelligence collection.\nYet, the motive might have less to do with minerals than with a technical reality: physics. The Arctic has become strategically indispensable because of the orbital mechanics that govern satellites. Whilst Trump noted that “Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships” [5], the real competition is in data streams connecting the seafloor to orbit.\n\n\n\nPituffik Space Base in north-western Greenland, showing the settlement layout and associated infrastructure within a high-Arctic coastal environment.\n\n\nThe traditional concepts of territorial sovereignty prove spectacularly ill-suited to contemporary strategic requirements. These contests do not unfold at the level of flags or borders, but in the ambiguous spaces where infrastructure, science, and strategy overlap—spaces in which presence itself has become power.\nConsider a reconnaissance satellite. Polar orbits provide global coverage but converge at the poles. A ground station at 40°N might only contact a satellite three times daily [6]. In contrast, Greenland’s Pituffik Space Base at 76°N enables “14 of 14 capability”—near-continuous data collection [7].\n\n\n\nOrbital Mechanics & Geographic Military Advantage:Mid-latitude ground stations receive only 2–4 satellite passes per day, whereas Arctic ground stations receive all 14 daily passes, enabling near-real-time access.\n\n\nGeography asserts itself where technology cannot. The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) observes that “orbital access scarcity” is determined by location, not innovation [8]. States controlling Arctic territory control the bottlenecks of space-based intelligence.\nArctic ground stations are integrated with subsea fibre-optic cables. This creates a “subsurface-to-space nexus”: severing cables degrades orbital capabilities without touching the satellites themselves [9].\n &gt; Strategic Note: Attacks on cables preserve plausible deniability. One drags an anchor across a route, attributes it to error, and accomplishes strategic degradation below the threshold of war [8].\nRecent incidents involving the Chinese-flagged Yi Peng 3 and the severance of Svalbard’s cables highlight this vulnerability [10], [11]. The Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom (GIUK) Gap serves as both a submarine transit point and a cable concentration zone [12].\nIn addition, the legal framework governing the Arctic is outdated. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty and 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) did not anticipate ground station positioning or dual-use research facilities [13], [14]. This “legal lacuna” has allowed China’s Military-Civil Fusion doctrine to flourish in scientific installations [15].\nIn conclusion, geography has reasserted itself. Future military power will depend on the infrastructure linking Earth to orbit [16], [17]. Control of the Arctic infrastructure (i.e. the ground stations and cables) implies controlling the connective tissue of modern power [18].\n\nReferences\n[1] K.

    "text": "Does your team have a Spotted Ape? A brightly coloured B-24 Liberator from 1943 offers a lesson for the AI age: creative mentors who can bring order to chaos with a light touch.\nThe Spotted Ape - also called the Flying Spotted Ass Ape - was a battered bomber splashed with polka dots, circling East Anglia like a circus act that refused to land. Too weary for combat but too useful to discard, it had one task - to gather hundreds of bombers into formation before they vanished into the fog.\nThe skies over England were crowded and confused. Green crews lifted off from dozens of fields, often colliding before reaching altitude [1]. On 1 August 1943, during the raid on Ploiești, disarray in assembly and navigation cost 53 out of 177 aircraft and 310 lives [2]. The answer was absurd and brilliant: turn one old plane into a beacon [1]. Painted in clownish colours and fitted with flares, it would climb first, circle a fixed point, and signal until its flock formed [1]. When the bombers were ready, it dipped beneath the lead ship and went home [1]. The crews called it the “Judas Goat” - the guide that led others to battle but never joined the slaughter [1]."

    "section": "Lessons from a polka-dotted bomber",
    "text": "Lessons from a polka-dotted bomber\nThese garish aircraft became standard in late 1943 and 1944 as the Eighth Air Force expanded from a few hundred bombers to armadas of more than a thousand [1], [3]. During Big Week in February 1944, over a thousand bombers struck the German aircraft industry [4]. Similar numbers flew in the weeks before and after D-Day, hitting multiple targets [3]. By early 1945, raids on Berlin sent 1,400 bombers and nearly a thousand fighters into the air [3].\n\n\n\nThe challenge of forming hundreds of bombers into a protective “Combat Box” formation, often in the poor weather and low light over the English countryside, necessitated the use of Assembly Ships.\n\n\nWith such vast formations, order mattered more than firepower [1]. The assembly ships were not weapons but anchors. The 458th Bombardment Group at RAF Horsham St Faith had one of the most famous: the Flying Spotted Ass Ape, also known as the Spotted Ape [1]. For nearly a year, piloted by experienced crews, it guided every major mission without firing a shot [1]. The genius lay not in its technology but its psychology — visibility, credibility, and timing.\nThe same principles apply to modern creative teams, especially those navigating the turbulence of generative AI. Technology accelerates ideas but amplifies noise. Brilliant individuals chase their own trajectories. Deadlines loom. Meetings collide. Everyone is flying, but no one is forming. What the Spotted Ape offered in the air, creative teams now need on the ground: visible cues, calm example, practical wisdom, and the discipline to withdraw once the group finds its rhythm.\n\nExample\nAssembly ships did not command; they demonstrated. When one aircraft steadied its course, others followed. Leadership through example remains stronger than instruction [5]. When a senior creative admits uncertainty or pauses to recalibrate, it grants permission for others to do the same. Formation follows behaviour, not memos.\n\n\nExperience\nThe Spotted Ape was flown by veterans who knew turbulence, fuel strain and fear — the feel of the craft itself. Michael Polanyi called this “tacit knowledge,” the unspoken skill that resists codification [6]. An “indwelling” of routines and shared heuristics [6]. Modern leaders often hover above the work they manage. The best still know how to fly.\n\n\nExit\nOnce the bombers held formation, the Spotted Ape turned home [1]. Leadership that withdraws at the right moment leaves competence behind. Leadership that lingers breeds dependence. In many AI-driven teams, constant oversight creates learned helplessness. True guidance ends in self-correction."

    "text": "Deploying a modern Spotted Ape\nLaunching a modern Spotted Ape is about people, not platforms. Start complex projects with a seasoned guide for the first sprint — someone who reads personalities, spots friction early, and sets small rituals of alignment before the pressure sets in. Their role is to kindle autonomy, not control it. Once the rhythm holds, they step aside. Shared experiences humanise complexity. Mistakes become collective learning rather than individual blame. When these tacit rhythms take root, the team sustains itself. Research suggests that early mentorship can halve misalignment issues [7],[8]. and strengthen originality by improving idea flow and reducing relational fatigue [9]."

AI systems automate tasks but not trust. Creative leadership today requires less algorithmic literacy and more behavioural insight. The Spotted Ape reminds us of a simple truth: the most valuable person in the digital room is rarely the fastest coder or the slickest strategist. It is the steady collaborator — the one with empathy, imagination and a calming diplomatic nature — circling just long enough for everyone else to find formation. The bombers that made it home were not the strongest. They were the ones that learnt to fly together."

    "text": "Berlin-based artist David Szauder recently shared a video that left me both mesmerised and unsettled. Seemingly inspired by the enigmatic frog deity Kek—an ancient Egyptian symbol of darkness, chaos, and the unseen forces that bring light—Szauder’s work feels like a poetic response to the seismic shifts rippling through the creative industries today.\n\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by David Szauder (@davidszauder)\n\nThe video unfolds like a fever dream—or perhaps a digital-age myth—as amorphous, chaotic forms dissolve, shift, and reassemble into fleeting moments of clarity, all set to the iconic hip-hop anthem Jump by House of Pain. Ancient symbolism collides with 21st-century disarray, crafting what feels like a mesmerising digital afterlife for the world of myth.\nIn ancient Egypt, frogs were more than nocturnal creatures—they symbolised transformation, heralding light from the depths of darkness. In Szauder’s animation, the frog is reimagined as a stand-in for the disruptive force of AI: unsettling, unpredictable, and, as the playful title HTYGF (How to Train Your Giant Frog) suggests, impossibly transformative.\nWhat lingers, however, is not just the dazzling spectacle but the pressing questions it raises for the year ahead. Generative AI tools are rapidly challenging long-held workflows in 3D modelling and texturing. Where does this leave the artists and designers whose craft was built on manual precision and expertise? Are we witnessing the beginning of an unraveling—or the chaotic spark of an extraordinary creative renaissance?\nSzauder doesn’t attempt to answer these questions outright. Like Kek, who straddled the line between light and shadow, destruction and creation, his work suggests that progress often emerges from disruption. The animation asks us to confront the generative potential of chaos and to reimagine a creative industry suspended between anxiety and possibility.\nWatching his piece, I felt both excitement and unease. The frog myth has indeed leapt into the digital age, reminding us that, even in an AI-dominated landscape, the essence of creation still begins in the unknown.\nAs the lyrics echo in my mind:\n“You’ve got to get out your seat and jump around, Disruption’s the beat, so don’t stand your ground.“\nWhat’s your take? Is this a leap toward a brighter creative future—or a harbinger of chaos that challenges the very foundations of artistry?"

Om de beschikbare handhavingscapaciteit zo effectief mogelijk in te zetten, wil de gemeente deze heronderzoeken uitvoeren bij uitkeringsontvangers met de grootste kans op het onterecht ontvangen van een uitkering. Daarvoor is een risicomodel ontwikkeld dat onrechtmatigheden voorspelt.\nVoor de voorspelling worden persoonsgegevens, zoals leeftijd en geslacht, gebruikt die een correlatie hebben met een verhoogd risico op onrechtmatig gebruik van een bijstandsuitkering. De Rotterdamse Rekenkamer stelt dat dit kan resulteren in ongewenste discriminatie en de gemeente wil daarom deze gevoelige variabelen niet meer gebruiken.\nAls deze lijn wordt doorgezet zijn we hard op weg om het kind met het badwater weg te gooien. We kunnen dan net zo goed meteen stoppen met het investeren van tijd en geld in de ontwikkeling van algoritmen voor risicoprofilering door de toezichthoudende overheid.

Zij laten zien hoe een technisch team tijdens de ontwikkelfase alle mogelijke variabelen gebruikt om het algoritme te ‘trainen’ om recidiverisico te bepalen. In de gebruiksfase bepalen beleidsmakers dan welke variabelen gebruikt mogen worden om dit risico te voorspellen en daadwerkelijk mee te wegen in de uitspraak.\nStel, er is een hoge correlatie tussen recidiverisico en nationaliteit. Omdat we het onwenselijk vinden dat nationaliteit een overweging is voor de rechtspraak, wordt deze variabele wel gebruikt in de ontwikkelfase van het algoritme, maar wordt hij achterwege gelaten (geblindeerd) in het berekenen van het recidiverisico. Hiermee wordt discriminatie effectief tegengegaan."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Met de komst van de AI Verordening moeten alle organisaties die AI gebruiken of ontwikkelen vanaf deze maand ervoor zorgen dat hun medewerkers ‘AI-geletterd’ zijn. Los van de vraag of het zinnig is om dit als verplichting op te nemen in een nieuwe wet - daarover later meer - lijkt mij dit op zich een goede zaak. Het is logisch om binnen de toenemende digitalisering van onze samenleving aandacht te vragen voor digitale vaardigheden (“bekwaamheid en begrip van internet-, computer- en softwaregebruik”), datageletterdheid (“vermogen om zinvolle informatie af te leiden uit gegevens (data) en gegevensverzamelingen”) en nu dus ook AI-geletterdheid (“vaardigheden, kennis en begrip hebben over de technische werking van AI-systemen, maar ook over de sociale, ethische en praktische aspecten”). Het is misschien behulpzaam om deze vaardigheden als concentrische cirkels te zien, waarbij ik denk dat AI-geletterdheid niet kan zonder datageletterdheid en digitale vaardigheden daar weer een onderliggende basis voor is.\nWeinig mensen zullen aanstoot nemen om brede maatschappelijke aandacht te vragen voor het ontwikkelen van deze vaardigheden. Vrij beschikbare online cursussen zoals het Data Literacy Project en Elements of AI kan ik hiervoor van harte aanbevelen.1 Beide zijn zeer toegangkelijk en als je ze hebt afgerond zal de mystiek van data science en AI voor een groot deel verdwenen zijn. Mooi. Is dan hiermee alles gezegd?\nIk denk het niet. Ik kan mij namelijk niet aan de indruk ontrekken dat goed bedoelde initatieven die streven om kennis over data science en AI bij een breed publiek over te dragen nogal de neiging hebben om de basis van dit alles, namelijk wiskunde, uit de weg te gaan.2 Wellicht heeft het ermee te maken dat veel mensen last hebben van wiskunde-angst.\nWat zeg je, bestaat dat? Jazeker. Als ik voor de klas sta voor een nieuwe groep bij het Mastering Data Science & AI programma bij EAISI Academy, begin ik vaak met deelnemers te vragen hun hand op te steken als ze een lichte spanning voelen wanneer ze terugdenken het maken van wiskunde sommen tijdens hun middelbare schooltijd. Steevast gaat ongeveer een derde van de handen omhoog. Bij de verdediging van Daphne Miedema’s promotieonderzoek On Learning SQL leerde ik dat math anxiety inderdaad bij circa 30% van studenten in technische studies een beperkende rol speelt om optimaal analytische vaardigheden aan te leren. Mijn vraag die als grap bedoelt was, is een echt fenomeen waar we rekening mee moeten houden wanneer we zoveel mogelijk mensen voldoende vaardig willen maken op het gebied van data science en AI.\nAls mensen een goed beeld willen hebben van wat data science en AI wel - en vooral niet - is, dan ontkomen we er niet aan om basisprincipes uit de wiskunde over te brengen. Niet iedereen hoeft wiskundige formules te kunnen herleiden, maar beginselen zoals bijvoorbeeld kansberekening en het leren lezen van een histogram zijn denk ik concepten die iedereen op haar of zijn niveau een bepaald begrip voor moet ontwikkelen om data- en AI-geletterd te zijn. Daarbij is denk ik vanwege de hype rondom large language models inmiddels zo’n verwrongen beeld ontstaan van wat AI nu is, dat iedereeen die een cursus heeft gedaan ‘hoe leer je prompts schrijven’ denkt dat ze daarmee voldoende voorbereid zijn. Niks is minder waar. Zolang je geen idee hebt hoe LLMs worden getraind (het voorspellen van het volgende woord) is het lastig te begrijpen waarom ze soms onzin uitkramen.3\nHet verplicht stellen van AI-geletterdheid deed mij denken aan een discussie die ik had met een goede collega destijds bij T-Mobile. Hij was hoofd van juridische zaken, zeer belezen en we hadden altijd interessante discussies over maatschappelijke vraagstukken. Het was rond die tijd, in 2007/2008, dat wiskunde verplicht werd gesteld voor het VWO. Hij vond het onnodig en hield een vurig pleidooi over het belang van algemene vorming via verplicht taal- en geschiedenisonderwijs. Ik vond dat wiskunde net zo goed in die categorie valt, wat we dus nu data- en AI-geletterheid noemen. Maar het verplicht stellen heeft helaas weinig effect gehad: de wiskundeprestaties van Nederlandse scholieren zijn sinds 2006 nog niet eerder zo sterk gedaald.\nHet verplicht stellen van AI-geletterdheid zal denk ik niet tot het gewenste effect leiden als we ons niet inzetten om ‘wiskundegeletterdheid’ voor een groot publiek te verbeteren. En net zo is datageletterdheid een holle frase als we ons alleen richten op de organisatorische aspecten van data management of data-gedreven werken, zonder dieper te gaan op de principes van informatie modelering en kennisrepresentatie. De hamvraag is natuurlijk, hoe dan? Misschien heeft Menno een idee."

Gaan we de gegevens versleutelen, hanteren we een centrale of een gedistribueerde aanpak voor de analyse, is het mogelijk om met geanonimiseerde of gepseudonimiseerde data te werken: dergelijke afwegingen worden veelal in een vroege fase van het project besproken. Wanneer er eindelijk ruimte is voor de volgende stap, dan is er altijd wel een verstokte ‘voorvechter van privacy’ die betoogt dat het nu dan wel goed geregeld kan zijn, maar “wat als deze dataset in de toekomst wordt gekoppeld aan een andere dataset?” Het mozaïek-effect als laatste retorische redmiddel."

Met de komst van privacy-enhancing technologieën (PETs) kan men op een decentrale, federatieve manier data met elkaar delen terwijl het risico op herleidbaarheid tot een minimum is teruggebracht. Een recente studie van de Data Sharing Coalition geeft aan wat deze technieken zijn en hoe deze gebruikt kunnen worden. Simpel gezegd komt het erop neer dat we encryptietechnieken, zoals we gewend zijn om te gebruiken voor bijvoorbeeld websites, ook kunnen inzetten om berekeningen te maken op encrypted data. Een alledaagse analogie: u bent met 30 man op een verjaardag en benieuwd wat het hoogst genoten salaris is. Met behulp van PETs kan een dergelijke berekening worden uitgevoerd, waarbij geen van uw feestgenoten publiekelijk hoeft vrij te geven hoeveel hij of zij verdient. Door data niet te kopiëren en onder encryptie berekeningen uit te voeren, is de kans op herleidbaarheid minimaal."

Om te bepalen of een natuurlijke persoon identificeerbaar is, moet rekening worden gehouden met alle middelen “waarvan redelijkerwijs valt te verwachten dat zij worden gebruikt.” Als een ontvanger van gepseudonimiseerde data de sleutel niet heeft, zal hier veelal niet aan zijn voldaan, en is de AVG dus niet van toepassing, omdat niemands privacy in het geding is.\n\nDatasolidariteit als concept beoogt om betere, bewuste afwegingen te maken tussen collectieve en individuele belangen, tussen de huidige privacy en de gezondheidszorg van generaties na ons.\n\nDe Nederlandse AP neemt ten aanzien hiervan een strenger standpunt in; juist omdat bestanden eventueel ooit gekoppeld kunnen worden, zijn pseudonieme gegevens wat de AP betreft eigenlijk altijd toch gewoon persoonsgegevens. Elke theoretische mogelijkheid wordt dus meegewogen, niet elke mogelijkheid waarvan redelijkerwijs te verwachten is dat deze zal worden gebruikt. Deze interpretatie heeft eraan bijgedragen, dat een groot deel van de bevolking een zeer strenge positie inneemt: als data over mij gaan, dan zijn het automatisch persoonsgegevens die beschermd moeten worden, denkt men, terwijl het dan uitsluitend een toekomstige, theoretische mogelijkheid betreft. Wellicht ooit… denkt men. Punt is, als wellicht ooit de privacy inderdaad in het geding komt omdat door het mozaïek-effect bestanden herleidbaar worden, dan moet men gaan voldoen aan de zeer strenge eisen van de AVG, maar niet eerder dan dat."

Datasolidariteit als concept beoogt om betere, bewuste afwegingen te maken tussen collectieve en individuele belangen, tussen de huidige privacy en de gezondheidszorg van generaties na ons. De potentiële waarde creatie staat centraal; het doel dat men ermee beoogt te bereiken, en dus niet of de data-vrager bijvoorbeeld een (semi)publieke organisatie is. Er zijn massa’s private organisaties die maatschappelijk nut beogen, dus hen op deze grond passeren zonder ons te verdiepen in de vraag wat in een concreet geval met data wordt beoogd, zou discriminatie zijn. Bovendien wordt geld verdienen aan data steeds moeilijker gemaakt; ook in de (concept) EHDS staat dat bij het aanvragen van data veelal ten hoogste de marginale kosten in rekening mogen worden gebracht. Gezondheidsgegevens zijn immers een publiek goed, dat aan de gemeenschap ten goede moet komen. De datastromen moeten daarom net als fietspaden gefinancierd worden uit de grote pot. Het ongemak en onbehagen waarmee het debat over data delen in de zorg wordt gevoerd, terwijl de relevante wetgeving eigenlijk heel degelijk in elkaar steekt, geeft aan dat we ons samen moeten verdiepen in de juistheid van onze afwegingskaders. Het is niet a of b, de zaken liggen subtieler. Datasolidariteit als ethisch principe is wellicht een tegenhanger van de op het mozaïek-effect hamerende privacy-dogmatici, maar juist een partner van privacy-realisten. Want ook data-solidairen menen dat state of the art ICT moet worden ingezet om het vereiste vertrouwen te creëren, zodat gezondheidsdata kunnen worden ingezet voor publieke meerwaarde zonder iemand te schaden.\n\nDatasolidariteit gaat erom dat het verschil wordt gezien tussen een reëel privacy risico en een wat ongemakkelijk gevoel over een theoretische mogelijkheid."

Artsen beloven niet te schaden en deze belofte beperkt zich niet tot de huidige patiënten. Wat wij bedoelen met datasolidariteit is dus dit: een subtielere blik op privacy vraagstukken, in het belang van toekomstige patiënten. Datasolidariteit gaat erom dat het verschil wordt gezien tussen een reëel privacy risico en een wat ongemakkelijk gevoel over een theoretische mogelijkheid. Het voelt inderdaad niet zo prettig, als data die zijn verzameld terwijl je op een kwetsbaar moment bij een dokter zat, worden gebruikt voor onderzoek. Maar we moeten leren dat dit gevoel over het algemeen geen reële privacy risico’s oplevert. Dit, terwijl het nalaten van onderzoek de volgende generatie wel degelijk reële risico’s oplevert; het risico dat we bepaalde toekomstige patiënten niet kunnen helpen, wat met (solidair) dataonderzoek wel had gekund."

Bij het gebruiken van diensten van bedrijven als Google, Meta of Microsoft lijken veel mensen het niet zo nauw te nemen met privacy, waarschijnlijk omdat je er meteen iets voor terug krijgt, namelijk gratis toegang tot social media of een e-maildienst.\nAls het gaat om initiatieven als hiervoor genoemd verschijnen er ineens meer beren op de weg (misschien omdat je bij het beschikbaar stellen van jouw data voor maatschappelijke problemen er niet meteen iets voor terugkrijgt). Privacy wordt dan meestal (en helaas) als eerste argument opgevoerd om data niet te delen, terwijl dit niet een echte belemmering is.\nEr zijn voldoende juridische mogelijkheden om persoonsgegevens te delen en te hergebruiken – via CBS data delen is legaal, wettelijk geregeld. In het geval van de vaccinatiegegevens stelt de Landsadvocaat in een advies dat er zelfs twee juridische redeneringen zijn waarmee het RIVM de data aan het CBS ter beschikking kan stellen, namelijk binnen de wet op het CBS en op basis van de AVG. Na veel vertraging komen de data uiteindelijk dan toch beschikbaar.5\nWel is er een gebrek aan bestuurlijke instrumenten om hergebruik van data in goede banen te leiden. De wet- en regelgeving is dusdanig complex dat vaak tegenstrijdige uitspraken worden gedaan door juristen. Om dit probleem te adresseren is recentelijk door de overheid een adviesfunctie verantwoord datagebruik ingericht.6"

Ook staan wij er niet meer bij stil dat data tijdens transport altijd zijn versleuteld; we werken steeds meer thuis en loggen via een beveiligde verbinding (VPN) in op de online werkomgeving. Een logische vervolgstap is om berekeningen op versleutelde data te doen.\nIn de praktijk gebeurt dit al met nieuwe privacy enhancing technieken zoals secure multiparty computation (MPC)8. Hiermee is het mogelijk om berekeningen op data uit te voeren zonder dat je de data kunt inzien. Binnen Europa zijn inmiddels voorbeelden waar MPC wordt toegepast voor het delen van persoonsgegevens en andere gevoelige data, zoals bij het bestrijden van mensenhandel."

Als een bedrijf deze data wil gebruiken voor het ontwikkelen van algoritmes, dan zouden winsten daarvan terug moeten vloeien naar het zorgstelsel. Dit gebeurt nu niet of nauwelijks. De kosten voor het aanleggen van hoogwaardige datasets worden collectief gedragen, terwijl de winsten voor commerciële bedrijven zijn. Dat het ook anders kan laat Barcelona zien.9\nDe drie pilaren van datasolidariteit vereisen dat we het debat over het delen van persoonsgegevens niet meer laten kapen door discussies over privacy. In plaats daarvan moeten we de dialoog aangaan over de waarde van het delen van data voor het oplossen van maatschappelijke vraagstukken en de randvoorwaarden die daarvoor vervuld moeten worden."

Anderen waren van harte welkom om mee te doen. Vandaag de dag draait 96% van de grootste servers wereldwijd op Linux. In 1999 ging Red Hat naar de beurs. Zij bewezen daarmee dat het onmogelijke mogelijk is: een bedrijf bouwen op open source software en toch geld verdienen.\nNet zoals mijn voorganger in deze column, droom ik van een wereld waarin data niet wordt gezien als een commodity maar als een common pool resource. Een wereld waarin de broncode van algoritmes openbaar is en daarmee toetsbaar voor peer review. Kortom, een wereld waarin de hacking cultuur samenkomt met die van Elinor Ostrom. Helaas staan tussen droom en daad wetten in de weg, en praktische bezwaren.\nOf kan het toch? Droom eens met mij mee: we leggen voor de hele wereld een openbare database aan van beelden van borstkankercellen van zogenaamde HER2-positieve borstkanker. Deze vorm van kanker komt bij 19 op de 100.000 vrouwen voor en is met relatief goedkope beeldvormende diagnostiek vast te stellen. Omdat de database enkel foto’s van cellen bevat met een label kwaadaardig/goedaardig zijn er ook weinig belemmeringen wat betreft privacy. Deze database wordt vervolgens publiek beschikbaar gesteld zodat iedereen zelf een algoritme kan ontwikkelen. De enige verplichting is dat je het resultaat – het getrainde model, de broncode, de methodische verantwoording – ook weer deelt.\nIk stel mij voor dat een dergelijke aanpak binnen afzienbare termijn goede en robuuste algoritmes zal opleveren. Vanwege de volledige openheid van het ontwikkelproces, kan ook meteen worden voldaan aan een aantal belangrijke eisen van transparantie, uitlegbaarheid en reproduceerbaarheid voor hoog-risico toepassingen van algoritmes. Commerciële partijen kunnen zich via een open source business model richten op dienstverlening op het gebied van certificering, integratie met bestaande software systemen en het beheren van de levenscyclus van de modellen.\nDe werkelijkheid: op 30 september 2021 ontving de Hippo Foundation de Duitse AI startup prijs 2021.

    "text": "Reflectie: een donorcodicil voor je data?\nOp dinsdag 20 oktober vond de DDW-talk met het thema ‘Een donorcodicil voor je data?’ plaats. Het panel ging in gesprek over het gebruik van medische gegevens: hoe benutten we de kansen op dit gebied, terwijl we tegelijkertijd de privacy volgens de AVG-richtlijnen waarborgen?\nDe panelleden waren het erover eens: het is noodzakelijk om data binnen de zorg makkelijker te kunnen delen, zowel voor onderzoek als voor de praktijk. Het proces van triage aan het begin van een zorgtraject zou bijvoorbeeld versneld kunnen worden als er tussen verschillende partijen data kan worden gedeeld over de achtergrond van een patiënt. Op Europees niveau zijn binnen de Algemene verordening gegevensbescherming (AVG, oftewel GDPR) afspraken gemaakt over het verantwoord delen van data, wat dus ook invloed heeft op vrije data-uitwisseling in de zorg.\nTegelijkertijd zijn er problematische prikkels in het huidige onderzoekssysteem, waardoor (zorg-)instellingen elkaar beconcurreren op het gebied van kennisontwikkeling, in plaats van daarin samen te werken. De huidige COVID-pandemie maakt de urgentie van deelbare zorgdata alleen maar nog zichtbaarder: medische data waarop gestuurd zou moeten worden blijkt in de praktijk heel moeilijk vindbaar. Er moet dus een schaalbare manier gevonden worden voor in de toekomst: hoe kan zorgdata, en metadata over deze zorgdata, met het oog op de patiënt – dus vanuit publieke waarden – structureel en verantwoord worden ontsloten?\n\nEigenaarschap over data\nData en dataeigenaarschap zijn binnen Nederlandse wetgeving slechts in beperkte zin gedefinieerd. In de Uitvoeringswet AVG (UAVG) is het zelfbeschikkingsrecht van de burger ten opzichte van zijn data wél duidelijk opgenomen. Hier zit potentie: jouw persoonlijke gegevens mogen dus gebruikt worden door een partij, indien jij daar expliciet toestemming voor geeft. Momenteel gaat dat in de zorg via informed consent: van tevoren geeft de patiënt toestemming voor het gebruik van zijn data voor specifieke doeleinden. De AVG verplicht hierbij doelbinding, dus de data mag enkel voor het specifieke doel gebruikt worden waar vooraf toestemming voor is gegeven. Het is in die zin beperkend, en een zorginstelling moet telkens weer terug naar de patiënt om opnieuw toestemming te vragen mocht er iets veranderen binnen het onderzoek. We zouden eigenlijk toe willen naar een meer iteratief proces. Dit zou kunnen in de vorm van dynamisch informed consent: de patiënt stemt in met een groter aantal user cases (ook voor een veranderende context), krijgt daarbij feedback en kan zo constant inzien waarvoor zijn data gebruikt is.\nEen stap verder hierin is het werken richting een datacodicil: een constructie vergelijkbaar met het donorcodicil, waarbij de patiënt standaard zijn zorgdata deelt tenzij hij expliciet aangeeft voor welke doeleinden hij dat niet wil – waarbij als randvoorwaarde geldt dat de data niet wordt verkocht aan commerciële partijen. Dit gebeurt al in Engeland: iedereen doneert volgens de wet data aan de National Health Service (NHS) voor zowel onderzoek als het verbeteren van zorg, waarbij altijd kan worden gekozen voor een ‘opt-out’. (In de praktijk kiest minder dan tien procent van de patiënten hiervoor.) De overheid zou in het geval van een datacodicil een cruciale rol spelen in het scheppen van de juiste kaders als voorwaarden aan een dergelijke datasamenleving, met dus als basis dat de data niet voor commerciële doeleinden mag worden gebruikt (zoals ook in het geval van het donorcodicil). Ook het juiste taalgebruik en voorlichting zijn hierbij van cruciaal belang: het moet precies helder zijn waarvoor de persoonlijke gegevens gebruikt gaan worden.\nDatacommons kunnen hierbij een mogelijke rol spelen: data uit de zorg wordt publiek bezit en wordt voor collectief belang gebruikt. Het is essentieel om vanuit het belang van de patiënt te denken. Het delen van zorggegevens van een individu kan cruciaal zijn in onderzoek naar bepaalde aandoeningen en zo andere patiënten helpen, maar kan uiteindelijk ook de eigen toestand verbeteren. Het gaat dus om solidariteit voor anderen, maar ook om een intrinsieke waarde-motivatie om je data te delen.\n\n\nVertrouwensnetwerken\nHet is echter als individu moeilijk in te schatten wat hierin handige keuzes zijn. Hoe kun je als burger vaststellen of je data wel voor legitieme en niet-commerciële belangen wordt gebruikt? Met een algemene ‘opt-in’ kun je wel weer heel weinig controle uitvoeren op de inzet van je data. Het is belangrijk dat je als gebruiker grip krijgt op de kringen waarin je data rondgaat. De sprekers waren het erover eens dat vertrouwen het centrale issue is op dit punt: met welke partijen kun je een zodanige relatie opbouwen dat je hen je data toevertrouwt? Een praktische denkrichting is om voort te bouwen op bestaande relaties binnen de zorg, zoals de vertrouwensrelatie die een patiënt met zijn huisarts heeft. De patiënt zou dan met de huisarts kunnen afspreken welke data aan welke partijen mag worden verstrekt voor welke doeleinden, waarbij de patiënt dan bijvoorbeeld een keer per jaar feedback krijgt en eventueel wordt gevraagd om aan weer nieuw onderzoek bij te dragen (dus in de vorm van dynamisch informed consent). Voor de technische uitvoering zouden universitaire ziekenhuizen in aanmerking kunnen komen als betrouwbare, en op (publiek) onderzoek gerichte instituten.\nCommerciële marktpartijen zullen desalniettemin een rol blijven spelen in de zorg; ze zijn essentieel voor investeringen. We moeten dus naar een systeem toe waar overal recht aan wordt gedaan: zowel de privacy van gebruikers, als het belang van deelbare data én de noodzaak van investeringen door marktpartijen. Dit speelt bijvoorbeeld bij medische applicaties: er is sprake van een ‘mismatch’ tussen (gevalideerd) medisch onderzoek en het aanbod aan commerciële (non-gevalideerde) apps. Hierbij zou een mogelijkheid zijn het splitsen van de ontwikkelfase (van het algoritme) en de toepassing ervan in apps. Eerst wordt dus onderzoek gedaan met gevoelige data van patiënten, en als het algoritme eenmaal is ontwikkeld worden commerciële partijen betrokken om het in een applicatie vorm te geven. Voor deze eerste fase zien de panelleden potentie in het werken met het Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek (CBS), immers de enige grootschalige databeheerder waar momenteel wél duidelijke regelgeving over is.\nOok is het relevant om te denken in verschillende schaalniveaus. Op landelijk niveau is de overheid dus van belang voor het scheppen van duidelijke kaders. Daarnaast kan het nuttig zijn om in netwerken te gaan denken: zowel op basis van regionale structuren als op basis van expertise-netwerken rondom één aandoening. Het eerste gebeurt bijvoorbeeld in Rotterdam: het Erasmus MC werkt daar samen met onder andere de gemeente en de GGZ om triage voor kinderen met een psychiatrische aandoening te versnellen. Bij het tweede zouden koepelorganisaties van specifieke aandoeningen een rol kunnen spelen, bijvoorbeeld door het datacodicil van haar patiëntenleden te beheren en op basis daarvan toestemming te geven voor gebruik. Vervolgens zouden daar hybride businessmodellen bij kunnen worden gebouwd.\nEr is kortom enorm veel potentie om zorgdata op een nuttige, publiek wenselijke manier delen, maar het blijkt nog een uitdaging om in de praktijk in te richten. Het begint met een verandering van mindset: júist door data – vanuit een publiek, en niet commercieel oogpunt – te delen met andere organisaties kunnen grote stappen worden gezet, zowel in onderzoek als in verbetering van de zorg zelf. Dynamisch informed consent en een datacodicil bieden hierbij veelbelovende denkrichtingen. Het werken in (regionale en expertise-) netwerken, met een overheid die duidelijke kaders schept en marktpartijen die later in het proces pas aansluiten, kan zorgen voor het waarborgen van publieke waarden met de juiste vertrouwensbasis. Datacommons staan in de zorg nog in de kinderschoenen. Maar hopelijk kunnen we door de juiste samenwerking op korte termijn grote stappen zetten binnen een ongetwijfeld lang traject."

    "text": "Het debat over de toekomst van kunstmatige intelligentie (KI) is weer (nog?) in volle gang. Blij om te zien dat in Europa er meer aandacht voor is. De Fransen zouden de Fransen niet zijn als ze niet de moral high-ground claimen. Enfin, het is in elk geval een goede stap dat Europa haar eigen ambities en onderzoeksagenda voor kunstmatige intelligentie gaat vormgeven. Het valt mij op dat veiligheid en ethiek vaak genoemd wordt waarin Europa zich in kan onderscheiden. Vanuit de Future of Humanity Institute aan de University of Oxford wordt hier reeds onderzoek naar gedaan en breekt men een lans voor meer middelen voor veilige ontwikkeling van KI. Mogelijk kunnen we hier echt iets in betekenen.\n\n\nTegelijkertijd vraag ik mij af of wat ons te wachten zijn. Staan we echt aan de vooravond van singularity, met een reële kans dat we rond 2050 zullen worden gedomineerd door volwaardige, human-capable, superintelligente machines? Moeten we serieus gaan nadenken of we iets zoals Asimov’s drie wetten voor robots moeten gaan formuleren èn inbouwen in onze intelligente machines? Is het noodzakelijk, nuttig en/of relevant dat robots een mindontwikkelen, zodat we ze waarden kunnen meegeven? In zijn magnum opus From Bacteria to Bach and Back maakt Daniel Dennett onderscheid tussen competence (iets kunnen) versus comprehension (iets begrijpen). Vooralsnog is KI van vandaag de dag vooral competent, maar zijn we nog ver van begrip.\n\n\n\n\n\nEén vraag lijkt mij hoe dan ook het onderzoeken waard: waar gaan we de energie vandaan halen om KI te laten evolueren? Alan Winfield van de University of Bristol heeft een schatting gemaakt hoeveel energie nodig is om complex, kunstmatige leven te laten evolueren. Voorlopige conclusie: met die singularity zal het niet zo’n vaart lopen, totdat we efficiëntere substrates c.q. platformen hebben ontwikkeld om deep learning op te implementeren. Ter vergelijking: een supercomputer verbruikt net zoveel stroom als 10.000 huishoudens, een menselijk brein verbruikt slechts een equivalent van kleine ledlamp."

    "text": "Creative coding is fun if you know a thing or two about programming. And if, like me, you are an utter noob when it comes to brushes and pencils, then it is even more enticing as a means to express yourself and create something just for the sake of it. It doesn’t have to be functional, but you do get to hone your hacking skills and set challenges for yourself along the way.\nA fellow data scientist who is into “Art & AI” recently pointed me to the field of generative art. I have always been facinated by emergence and even more so when I came across the picture above. It is featured in this blog on how to draw a pencil-sketch-like forest with Processing. One thing led to another: I had a go at Processing in Python mode, dabbled with matplotlib for animations and read Schiffman’s the Nature of Code.\n“Would it be possible to create a Python project that can generate those pencil-like drawings with random forests, with different types of trees?”, I thought (pun intended). Of course, someone already thought of that and it even has a name: algorithmic botany. Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz and Aristid Lindenmayer wrote the seminal book on the subject in 1990, The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants. Lindenmayer invented L-systems already back in 1968. Today, household computers have enough resources to handle large-ish parallel writing systems and you could start modelling the growth of any plant using a framework like L-Py.\nAlthough a lot has been written on the subject and there are quite a few open source libraries, they weren’t quite what I have in mind. Instead, the idea of creating generative art in Python emerged using the following components:\nThe possibilities are endless and I can foresee spending way too much time on this. In this blog post, I will lay out the ideas behind this approach."

While I still struggle to apply recursion, I find it satisfying to solve coding problems this way. And even with just these twenty lines of code, we have already stumbled on the Fibonacci numbers! Have a look at the length of each successive sequence:\n\nprint([len(word) for word in productions])\n\n[1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]\n\n\nAwesome as the nature of code may be, we are still a long way off from actually generating a tree. For that, we need branching rules. To do so, basic L-systems also allow constants, which are left untouched by the production rules. It is common to add constants + and - to denote rotations when branching, and [,] for handling the locations of the branching points. For a fractal plant, the code is as follows:\n\nAXIOM = \"X\"\nRULES = {\"X\": \"F+[[X]-X]-F[-FX]+X\",\n         \"F\": \"FF\"}\nproductions = [AXIOM]\ngenerate_d0l(AXIOM, productions,

is amazing to see how complexity increases by adding slightly longer rules. To actually draw something, we translate the letters as follows: * “F” means “draw forward” * “-” means “turn right”, using a predefined value e.g. 30° * “+” means “turn left 30°” * “X” does not correspond to any drawing action and is used to control the evolution of the curve.\nThe square bracket “[” corresponds to saving the current values for position and angle, which are restored when the corresponding “]” is executed, which effectively is a LIFO stack. We will go into the details of how to draw later."

This could be used to thicken the width of a branch of a tree."

    "title": "Fairness bij gebruik van algoritmes in het verzekeringswezen",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Optimaliseren\nAls je algoritmes gebruikt om risicoprofielen te maken waarop vervolgens besluiten worden genomen, zal je volgens Kapitan moeten kiezen waarop het algoritme geoptimaliseerd moet worden. Denk bijvoorbeeld aan de afweging tussen zo min mogelijk fout positieven of fout negatieven. Deze keuze is direct gerelateerd aan een maatstaf voor eerlijkheid (fairness). Onderzoek wijst uit dat hier een keuze in gemaakt moet worden, omdat verschillende definities van fairness wiskundig onverenigbaar zijn.\n\n\nActuarial fairness onmogelijk\nKapitan: “eerlijkheid is wiskundig gezien een onoplosbaar probleem dat zelfs de beste wiskundigen niet voor de verzekeringsbranche kunnen oplossen.” Voor zijn uitspraak refereert hij onder andere aan een artikel van Joachim Baumann. Om dat te duiden begint hij bij actuarial fairness. Dat houdt in dat iemand die een hoger risico loopt meer premie betaalt. “Over het algemeen vinden we dat eerlijk, toch?” vraagt hij zich hardop af.\n“Maar in zijn artikel stelt Baumann dat actuarial fairness wiskundig gezien helemaal niet mogelijk is. Want het échte risico op individueel niveau is niet meetbaar. Je zult het risico hooguit kunnen benaderen. Daarom kunnen we alléén fairness tussen groepen met elkaar vergelijken. Maar wat is dan eerlijk? Geef je bijvoorbeeld iedereen een gelijk uitgangspunt? Of een gelijke kans?”\nHij vervolgt: “Ervan uitgaande dat Baumann gelijk heeft, zijn er tools en wiskundige formules beschikbaar om group fairness in te zetten. En ja, je wilt als verzekeraar uiteindelijk toewerken naar individuele premies, maar deze kun je in de praktijk alleen bij benadering uitrekenen met gebruik van technieken gebaseerd op group fairness.” Kapitan benadrukt daarbij dat hij geen verzekeringsdeskundige is, maar dat hij zich in zijn analyse heeft laten leiden door Baumann, doch ook door het advies van het College voor de Rechten van de Mens over de Dazure overlijdensrisicoverzekering.\n\n\nSoorten group fairness\nOp basis van literatuur zijn er volgens Kapitan grosso modo drie group fairness-definities te onderscheiden:\n\nDefinitie 1: Onafhankelijkheid (Independence)\nDeze definitie houdt in dat iedereen gelijk wordt behandeld. Een voorbeeld hiervan is de casus ‘Arrest Test-Aankoop’. De uitkomst van dit arrest is dat het vanaf december 2012 niet meer is toegestaan om bij verzekeringsproducten verschil te maken tussen mannen en vrouwen wat betreft premies of uitkeringen. Zelfs niet als vrouwen een lager risico hebben op ongelukken, en langer leven. De uitkomsten voor de groepen mannen en vrouwen moet dus onafhankelijk zijn van de variabele ‘sekse’.\n\n\nDefinitie 2: Gelijkheid (Separation)\nDit betekent dat de kans op fouten hetzelfde is tussen groepen, gezien vanuit het perspectief vanuit de verzekerde. Een voorbeeld hiervan is de eerdergenoemde casus ’Dazure levensverzekeringen’.\nDus stel; je woont in een postcodegebied en je hebt een hoog inkomen. Maar in dat postcodegebied ben je een uitzondering. Jij krijgt dan een lagere premie dan past bij jouw risico. De Engelse term voor de vorm van group fairness wordt ook wel ‘equal odds’ genoemd, dat wil zeggen dat fairness in deze definitie betekent dat iedereen dezelfde kans heeft op een ‘foute’ risico-indeling, ongeacht tot welke groep je ook behoort,\n\n\nDefinitie 3: Calibratie (Sufficiency)\nDe derde definitie houdt in dat de kans op fouten hetzelfde is tussen groepen, gezien vanuit het perspectief vanuit de verzekeraar. Een voorbeeld hiervan is de casus ‘Voorspellen van kredietwaardigheid’.\nHet calibreren van een model wil zeggen dat je een vergelijking maakt tussen voorspelde waarden en echte waarden. De calibratie van het model, dus hoe goed het model voorspelt, moet volgens deze opvatting van fairness hetzelfde zijn voor alle groepen. Dit is volgens Baumann de meest eerlijke werkvorm, omdat je eist dat de voorspellingen die een algoritme maakt en waarom een premie wordt gebaseerd, een-op-een evenredig moet zijn met de werkelijke schadelast van de groep. Let wel: calibratie is niet genoeg om actuarial fairness te garanderen. Maar Baumann heeft wiskundig bewezen dat als er sprake is van actuarial fairness, er in elk geval sprake moet zijn van calibratie.\n\n\n\nPleidooi\n“Wat hij in het stuk ook zo mooi beschrijft,” vult Kapitan aan, “is dat verzekeraars uiteindelijk zoveel mogelijk klantgericht willen werken op basis van gepersonaliseerde premies. En omdat je dan uitsluitend met group fairness kunt werken, is Baumanns pleidooi: de enige manier om perfecte individuele premies te benaderen, is gebruikmaken van calibratie.” Kapitan is het met hem eens: “Ik vind zijn argumenten het meest overtuigend, omdat die het dichtst liggen bij wat ik denk dat de meest robuuste algoritmes zijn. Wel is er echt nog meer causistiek nodig of dit in de praktijk te doen is. Deze verschillende noties van group fairness zijn slechts een startpunt.”\n\n\nKiezen\nVolgens Kapitan is het aan verzekeraars om uit te zoeken en intern afspraken te maken over wat ‘eerlijkheid’ in verzekeringstermen precies is. Het is nodig om daarbij steeds een bewuste afweging te maken, omdat drie principes niet verenigbaar zijn. “Je moet kiezen. En op basis van wat bijvoorbeeld de directie of pricing board kiest, weten data scientists hoe zij algoritmes moeten trainen en optimaliseren om producten op een eerlijke manier te personaliseren.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeer weten over group fairness?\n\n\n\nHet open access boek Fairness and Machine Learning geeft een uitgebreide introductie en uitleg over dit onderwerp."
