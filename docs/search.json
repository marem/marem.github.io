Execution is rarely the problem. The flaw lies in how we frame the challenge from the start. Painpoints and problems are frequently misnamed, oversimplified, already compromised by the quiet drag of organisational inertia.\n\n\nDesigning for Reality\nI partner with teams facing complexity and ambiguity to turn abstract ambition into outcomes that survive the “push back” of reality. Organisations are not machines; they are complex material, social, and mental ecosystems. Navigating them requires pattern recognition, timing, and a deep sensitivity to context.\nI help you bridge the gap between where you are and where the strategy says you should be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategic Design Consulting\nMy job is to interrogate underlying logic and stress-test the story. I bring strategy into alignment with the constraints and conditions that will shape its success. By identifying operational tensions early, I help teams prioritise based on what can actually move, not just what looks impressive.\nProblem Reframing | Stress-Testing Logic | Operational Alignment | Decision Architecture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystemic Change\nLeading solutions in energy, urban development, and public services requires a systemic lens. I work across silos to translate ideas into decisions, and decisions into action. I act as an “early warning system,” sensing misalignment before it hardens into conflict or inertia.\nPublic Service Innovation | Urban Development Strategy | Energy Transition | Systemic Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBehavioural Science & Design\nDesigning for humans requires understanding the intersection of policy, technology, and human behaviour. I help organisations navigate the complex fault lines where strategy meets culture. This is the “invisible function” of a strategist: making sense of ambiguity to keep strategy grounded in human conditions.\nHuman-Centred Design | Behavioural Insights | Organisational Psychology | Cultural Alignment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasterclasses & Speaking\nI provide sessions designed to help leadership teams think clearly under pressure. These are not standard lectures, but provocations meant to demystify complexity and help professionals obtain the strategic autonomy needed to imagine and create in high-stakes environments.\nExecutive Masterclasses | Strategic Workshops | Keynote Provocations | Leadership Coaching\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I help organisations turn strategy into outcomes that hold up under pressure.”\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\nAbout me\n\nI’m a strategic design consultant with over twenty years of experience working across academia, behavioural science, and digital innovation. I currently lead Moruti Consulting, where I focus on designing solutions that support sustainable, systemic change in energy, urban development, and public services.\nMy work sits at the intersection of policy, technology, and human behaviour. I work with teams who are grappling with the reality of complexity and the weight of organisational inertia. I view my role as part editor, part interpreter, and part early warning system—spotting fault lines early and keeping strategy grounded in the conditions that matter most.\nStrategy often fails because it is treated as a plan for a machine. I treat organisations as social ecosystems. My goal is to bring clarity to problems before they become expensive distractions and to ensure that ambition is met with an equal measure of operational reality.\n\nAreas of Expertise\nStrategic Design, Problem Reframing, Systemic Change, Behavioural Science, Digital Innovation, Public Service Design, Energy Transition, and Urban Development.\n\n\nLocations\nBased in Cape Town, South Africa, working globally to help organisations navigate ambiguity and deliver meaningful impact.\n\n\nContact details\nEmail: contact@marcelmare.com\nSocials: LinkedIn | Instagram\n\nGet in touch"
