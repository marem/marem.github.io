<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="executive-snapshot">1. Executive Snapshot</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Role:</strong> Behavioural Researcher &amp; Strategic Design Lead</li>
<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Multi-phase community intervention</li>
<li><strong>Context:</strong> Informal settlement households using unsafe flame-based cooking systems</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Core Problem:</strong> Low adoption of safer cookstove technologies despite significant health and safety risks.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Designed and implemented a community-based behavioural intervention using bread-baking as a participatory catalyst, contributing to measurable shifts in cookstove ownership patterns and safety perceptions.</p>
</section>
<section id="strategic-context" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="strategic-context">2. Strategic Context</h2>
<p>In many low-resource South African communities, households rely on open-flame cooking systems, paraffin, and biomass fuels, often within structurally unsafe stoves.</p>
<p><strong>Consequences include:</strong> - Respiratory illness and indoor air pollution - Burn injuries - Fuel inefficiency and financial strain</p>
<p>Despite the availability of safer alternatives, adoption rates remained low because barriers were not purely economic—they were behavioural, cultural, and identity-linked. The challenge was shifted from a product distribution problem to a <strong>behavioural systems challenge</strong>: shifting motivations and norms without imposing external solutions.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Role:</strong> Behavioural Strategist (Collaborator with BCA Team)</li>
<li><strong>Target Group:</strong> Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) at risk of HIV</li>
<li><strong>Context:</strong> Public health crisis involving low medication adherence</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Core Problem:</strong> High rates of HIV risk paired with low adherence to life-saving antiretroviral (ARV) medication and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among vulnerable youth populations.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Developed a multi-channel behavioural journey that successfully improved adherence rates by aligning communication “nudges” with the core motivations of the target demographic.</p>
</section>
<section id="strategic-context" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="strategic-context">2. Strategic Context</h2>
<p>In the fight against HIV, the availability of medication (ARVs and PrEP) is only half the battle. For adolescent girls and young women, the barriers to consistent usage are often non-clinical, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Social Stigma:</strong> Fear of being seen with medication.</li>
<li><strong>Routine Disruption:</strong> Difficulty integrating daily pills into fluid lifestyles.</li>
<li><strong>Motivation Gaps:</strong> A lack of immediate perceived benefit vs.&nbsp;long-term risk.</li>
</ul>
<p>The project aimed to transform medical compliance into a relatable, motivated daily habit.</p>
</section>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="intervention-design-the-behavioural-journey">3. Intervention Design: The Behavioural Journey</h2>
<p>The intervention was built on a comprehensive <strong>behavioural journey map</strong> that identified every friction point from initial awareness to daily pill-taking.</p>
<section id="key-design-pillars" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-design-pillars">Key Design Pillars</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motivation-Linked Touchpoints:</strong> Every interaction was designed to trigger a specific internal motivator (e.g., autonomy, safety, or future-self aspirations).</li>
<li><strong>The “Nudge” Ecosystem:</strong> Rather than a single message, we created a surrounding environment of reminders.</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section id="implementation-touchpoints" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implementation-touchpoints">4. Implementation &amp; Touchpoints</h2>
<p>The strategy was deployed across multiple channels to meet users where they already exist:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Community Radio Spots:</strong> Used for broad social proof and to normalise the conversation around PrEP/ARVs.</li>
<li><strong>Social Media Messaging:</strong> Targeted content designed to build a supportive digital community and reduce stigma.</li>
<li><strong>Personalised Reminders:</strong> Direct-to-user nudges that felt supportive rather than clinical, helping to overcome the “forgetting” barrier.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="impact-evidence" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="impact-evidence">5. Impact &amp; Evidence</h2>
<p>The project successfully shifted the needle on adherence through:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved Adherence Rates:</strong> Measurable increase in consistent ARV and PrEP usage among the target cohort.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Motivation:</strong> Qualitative feedback indicated that users felt more empowered and less “policed” regarding their health choices.</li>
<li><strong>Optimised Communication:</strong> Evidence-based refinement of which messages resonated most with AGYW.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="strategic-value-transferability" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="strategic-value-transferability">6. Strategic Value &amp; Transferability</h2>
<p>This project illustrates the power of <strong>Behavioural Design</strong> in a public health context. The framework of mapping “touchpoints to motivations” is highly transferable to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chronic Disease Management:</strong> Improving long-term adherence for diabetes or hypertension.</li>
<li><strong>Preventative Health:</strong> Encouraging vaccination uptake or regular screenings.</li>
<li><strong>Youth Engagement:</strong> Designing social services that resonate with hard-to-reach younger demographics.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Would you like me to expand the <strong>Implementation</strong> section with specific examples of the social media messaging used to reduce stigma?```</p>
