### 1. Executive Snapshot

- **Role:** Co-Designer & Lead Research Facilitator
- **Duration:** Multi-session workshop series
- **Target Group:** Emerging young Black creatives
- **Context:** Creative economy skills gap amid rapid AI integration

**Core Problem:** Young creatives lacked structured support to integrate AI tools into their practice in a way that strengthened rather than diluted creative identity and employability.

**Outcome:** Developed and delivered a research-informed behavioural curriculum integrating AI tools to enhance creative confidence, identity clarity and portfolio readiness.

### 2. Strategic Context

The acceleration of generative AI tools has disrupted entry pathways into the creative industries. For historically marginalised creatives, this presented both:

- Opportunity (expanded tool access)
- Risk (skill displacement and identity erosion)

There was limited structured education focused on:

- Ethical AI integration
- Identity formation
- Translating AI fluency into employability

The intervention aimed to close this capability gap.

### 3. Research & Diagnostic Phase

#### Research Questions

- How do emerging creatives perceive AI in relation to authorship and identity?
- What capability gaps limit effective AI adoption?
- What behavioural barriers affect experimentation and confidence?

#### Methods

- Pre-workshop reflective surveys
- Facilitated group discussions
- In-session observation
- Iterative feedback loops
- Artefact analysis (outputs created using AI tools)

#### Tools Explored

- Figma (design workflows)
- Midjourney (visual generation)
- ChatGPT (ideation & structuring)
- RunwayML (video augmentation)
- Jitter (motion design)

#### Constraints

- Uneven digital literacy
- Variable access to hardware
- Psychological resistance to AI

### 4. Key Insights

1.  **Identity Anxiety:** Participants feared AI would replace their originality.
2.  **Tool Overwhelm:** Exposure without structure led to shallow experimentation.
3.  **Confidence Deficit:** Low belief in professional competitiveness limited ambition.
4.  **Opportunity Gap:** Few participants knew how to translate AI use into employability language.

### 5. Intervention Design

Based on findings, the curriculum was structured around three behavioural pillars:

1.  **Identity Before Tools:** Reflection-first exercises anchored AI use in personal narrative.
2.  **Structured Experimentation:** Tool use embedded within defined creative challenges.
3.  **Translation to Employability:** Outputs reframed as portfolio artefacts with articulated design rationale.

The workshops combined:

- Guided prompts
- Co-creation exercises
- Live tool demonstration
- Structured critique cycles
- Meta-reflection

### 6. Implementation

- Multi-session modular format
- Progressive tool complexity
- Peer collaboration
- Iterative content refinement
- Adaptive pacing based on cohort feedback

### 7. Impact & Evidence

Qualitative outcomes included:

- Increased reported confidence in AI tool usage
- Stronger articulation of creative identity
- Production of portfolio-ready artefacts
- Greater clarity on positioning within creative industry roles

Behavioural indicators observed:

- Reduced hesitation in tool experimentation
- Increased peer feedback engagement
- Clearer self-descriptions of creative value proposition

### 8. Strategic Value & Transferability

This intervention demonstrates:

- Behavioural design applied to capability development
- Ethical AI integration frameworks
- Curriculum architecture for digital transformation
- Scalable model for educational institutions or corporate upskilling

Transferable to:

- Corporate AI onboarding
- Innovation team capability building
- University-level digital design curricula
- Workforce development programmes
