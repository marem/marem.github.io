## 1. Executive Snapshot

- **Role:** Assistant Designer & Technical Mentor
- **Context:** Commonwealth Games
- **Target Group:** High-performance coaching staff and athletes

**Core Problem:** The need for a seamless, real-time method to capture and relay athletic performance data to coaching staff during high-stakes competition.

**Outcome:** Designed and implemented a remote real-time digital video production system that enabled immediate performance feedback, significantly enhancing the coaching experience.

## 2. Strategic Context

During major sporting events like the Commonwealth Games, the margin between winning and losing is often found in immediate technical adjustments. Traditional video analysis often suffered from:

- Latency in footage availability.
- Fragmented communication between capture teams and coaches.
- Limited tools for real-time visual breakdown.

This project aimed to close the gap between performance and analysis through a dedicated digital video infrastructure.

## 3. Research & Interaction Design

The system was built with a focus on **Interaction Design**, ensuring that the technical complexity of remote production did not hinder the speed of coaching decisions.

### Key Focus Areas:
- **Real-Time Latency:** Reducing the delay between the athletic action and the video relay.
- **Remote Access:** Ensuring coaching staff could access high-quality feeds from various vantage points.
- **User Interface:** Streamlining the capture process to be intuitive for production teams.

## 4. Implementation & Mentoring

Beyond the technical architecture, a significant portion of the project focused on capability building:

- **System Deployment:** Executed the seamless capture and relay of athletic performance across multiple event sites.
- **Mentoring:** Provided hands-on training for the team in non-linear video editing techniques.
- **Tool Creation:** Developed custom digital coaching tools to facilitate on-the-fly performance analysis.

## 5. Impact & Evidence

The intervention fundamentally changed how coaching staff interacted with performance data:

- **Revolutionised Coaching Experience:** Enabled "live" tactical adjustments based on instant video playback.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Streamlined the workflow from capture to analysis, removing technical bottlenecks.
- **Team Capability:** Successfully upskilled production staff in advanced editing and digital tool usage.

## 6. Strategic Value & Transferability

This project demonstrates the successful application of interaction design in high-pressure, real-time environments. The model is transferable to:

- **Live Broadcast & Media:** Enhancing remote production workflows.
- **Industrial Tele-operation:** Applying real-time video relay to remote monitoring and control.
- **High-Performance Training:** Scaling digital coaching tools for professional sports academies and Olympic programmes.
