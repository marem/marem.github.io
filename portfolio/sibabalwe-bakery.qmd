subtitle: "Behavioural Intervention for Safe Energy Adoption & Cookstove Transition"

description: |
    The Sibabalwe Bakery campaign was implemented to promote safe flame-based cooking practices. The behavioural intervention utilised a novel community-based bread-baking concept. Households in South Africa use dangerous and inefficient cookstoves facing significant health risks. In mitigation, we employed co-creative workshops and emo-demo campaigns, ultimately influencing motivations linked to cooking with fire resulting in positive shift in cookstove ownership patterns.

### 1. Executive Snapshot

- **Role:** Behavioural Researcher & Strategic Design Lead
- **Duration:** Multi-phase community intervention
- **Context:** Informal settlement households using unsafe flame-based cooking systems

**Core Problem:** Low adoption of safer cookstove technologies despite significant health and safety risks.

**Outcome:** Designed and implemented a community-based behavioural intervention using bread-baking as a participatory catalyst, contributing to measurable shifts in cookstove ownership patterns and safety perceptions.

### 2. Strategic Context

In many low-resource South African communities, households rely on open-flame cooking systems, paraffin, and biomass fuels, often within structurally unsafe stoves.

**Consequences include:**
- Respiratory illness and indoor air pollution
- Burn injuries
- Fuel inefficiency and financial strain

Despite the availability of safer alternatives, adoption rates remained low because barriers were not purely economic—they were behavioural, cultural, and identity-linked. The challenge was shifted from a product distribution problem to a **behavioural systems challenge**: shifting motivations and norms without imposing external solutions.

### 3. Research & Diagnostic Phase

#### Research Questions
- What symbolic and cultural meanings are attached to cooking with fire?
- What prevents households from transitioning to safer cookstoves?
- Which social influences shape ownership decisions?
- How do risk perceptions align with daily lived realities?

#### Methods
- Ethnographic fieldwork and in-home observations
- Semi-structured interviews and behavioural mapping
- Co-creation workshops and informal community discussions
- Artefact analysis of existing stove types and usage patterns

#### Constraints
- Financial vulnerability and infrastructure instability
- Deep-rooted cooking traditions
- Trust barriers toward external interventions

> **Key Diagnostic Insight:** The cookstove was not merely a utility device; it represented identity, competence, and family provision. Therefore, messaging focused solely on "health risks" failed to motivate change.

### 4. Key Behavioural Insights

1.  **Normalisation of Risk:** Health dangers were acknowledged but behaviourally discounted.
2.  **Social Proof Dominance:** Adoption decisions were strongly influenced by visible community norms.
3.  **Aspirational Identity Leverage:** Participants responded better to narratives of capability and pride than to fear.
4.  **Demonstration Over Instruction:** Hands-on experience produced stronger engagement than informational campaigns.

### 5. Intervention Design

The curriculum was structured around three behavioural pillars:

1.  **Reframe Cooking with Improved Cookstoves** Rather than attacking the use of "inefficient" cooking methods, the intervention elevated controlled, skilled routines with improved cooking technologies through baking bread.
2.  **Social Visibility:** Creating shared baking events to establish new behavioural routines and norms.
3.  **Emotional Demonstration (Emo-Demo):** Using experiential sessions to embed safety practices through participation.

#### The Sibabalwe Bakery Model
The bakery acted as a stage for collective preparation, sharing, and open discussion of safe, clean and economically viable cooking practices.

### 6. Implementation

- Facilitated co-creative workshops with community ambassadors.
- Iterative refinement of demonstration formats based on cohort feedback.
- Embedded reflective discussions and monitoring of post-intervention choices.
- Adaptive pacing to manage resource constraints and infrastructure disruptions.

### 7. Impact & Evidence

**Qualitative outcomes included:**
- Increased discussion and visibility of stove safety within households.
- Shift in expressed motivations for stove choice.
- Positive changes in ownership patterns following intervention cycles.

**Behavioural indicators observed:**
- Participants voluntarily demonstrating safer cooking techniques to peers.
- Organic emergence of peer-to-peer advocacy.
- Increased inquiry into alternative, safer stove options.

### 8. Strategic Value & Transferability

This intervention demonstrates the application of behavioural design to digital and physical transformation. It provides a scalable model for:

- **Public Health & Sustainability:** Energy transition through social leverage.
- **Corporate ESG:** Community-driven norm transformation for product adoption.
- **Policy Design:** Workforce and community development through participatory interventions.
